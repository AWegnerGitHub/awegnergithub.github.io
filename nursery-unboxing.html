<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html">last post</a>, I opened all of the boxes related to my new indoor, hydroponic
garden from <a href="https://risegardens.com/">Rise Gardens</a>. Today's post goes over the opening of the
three nurseries I received. Let's continue my review of the new Rise Gardens farm!</p>
<p>I mentioned in my <a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html">first post</a>, that there were shipping delays with the garden. One
of the things that Rise Gardens did to make up for this was ship additional nurseries,
nutrients and seeds.</p>
<p>The nurseries showed up a week before the garden did. Had I been planning properly, I would have
set them up at that time. That way when the garden arrived I'd be a week into waiting for my
sprouts. Alas, I did not, so the garden was assembled the same day the nurseries were started.</p>
<p>Oh well. On to the unboxing!</p>
<h2 id="the-unboxing">The Unboxing<a class="headerlink" href="#the-unboxing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p><img alt="Boxes of nurseries" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/nurseries_boxed.jpg"/></p>
<p>The nurseries showed up in three boxes, all taped together. This should have been my first indication
that the company loves tape.</p>
<p><img alt="Inside of the boxes" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/box_1_seeds_instructions.jpg"/></p>
<p>Boxes two and three had identical contents. Box one had a couple extras. The first extra
was this nice quick start guide.</p>
<p><img alt="Quick Start - Inside" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/inside_instructions.jpg"/></p>
<p>It very quickly covers what's in the three boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutrient Sensor</li>
<li>Batteries</li>
<li>Nutrients</li>
<li>Plant Holders (12 for the nursery, plus 6 extra for the next round of plants)</li>
<li>Seed packs. It says 4, but boxes two and three actually had five seed packs</li>
</ul>
<p>It also gives you a quick overview of how to use the nursery. It's pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the cover off a seed pod</li>
<li>Don't dump out the seed</li>
<li>Place it in the nursery</li>
<li>Put in the appropriate amount of water</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Quick Start - Back" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/back_instructions.jpg"/></p>
<p>The last step in the quick start is a note on the application provide by Rise Gardens.
I'm new at hydroponics, so I'm looking forward to using this for the first few growing
cycles. I'm also hoping that I learn something about how much nutrient solution I should
be adding, so that I don't need to be reliant on the app in the future. We'll see
how that works out. Technology is nice.</p>
<p><img alt="Nursery" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/nursery.jpg"/></p>
<p>On to the nursery! I'm going to admit, I was surprised by how small this nursery is.
I don't know what I was expecting, but it was larger. Now that I've thought about it for
more than five seconds though, this is perfect. This is a <em>nursery</em>. It's designed to
help the plants sprout, not grow. That's what the garden is for.</p>
<p>The nursery holds twelve plant pods and has a hole for adding water. If you look closely at the
inside of the quick start guide, you'll see the nice bold warning: Never add nutrients to nursery.</p>
<p><img alt="Plant Pod" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/plant_holder.jpg"/></p>
<p>The plant pods, or net cups as the quick start calls them, clips into the nursery. They are
easy to add and remove. They are also much more solidly built than the plastic of the
nursery. I'm interested in seeing how the nursery holds up after a couple cycles of
clipping/unclipping these pods.</p>
<p><img alt="Nutrient Sensor" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/water_tester.jpg"/></p>
<p>The last thing in the first box, apart from the seeds, is the nutrient sensor and
extra batteries. Before I migrate plants from the nursery to the garden, I'll read
up on how this works. In the mean time, quickly looking at it I see that it does
pH readings and EC (electro-current) readings. As I go through a few cycles, and with
the help of the app, I'll figure out what is the correct range of values for each of these.</p>
<p><img alt="Nutrients" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/nutrients.jpg"/></p>
<p>In boxes two and three, there were nutrients for the garden. It's not mentioned
in the quick start, but in the large instruction manual provided with the garden itself,
there are brief instructions on the difference between the two provided here. The
general idea, though, is that it helps the plants grow and produce. Obviously.</p>
<h2 id="the-seeds">The seeds<a class="headerlink" href="#the-seeds" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we get to the seeds. What will I be growing on the first round of two of plants.
With a three tier garden, and three nurseries, I have room for 36 individual. That's a
lot of vegetables all at once. I'm planning on staggering these in 3-4 week batches. That
what I don't get 40 tomatoes all at once.</p>
<p>In the boxes, I received the same plants for each, plus an extra box of chamomile in
boxes two and three. That's eight pods. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that
much chamomile, but I'll figure it out.</p>
<h3 id="salad-mix">Salad Mix<a class="headerlink" href="#salad-mix" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Salad Mix" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/salad_mix.jpg"/></p>
<p>In each large box, I received two salad mix boxes. Each of these contains</p>
<ul>
<li>1 pod of Red Oak lettuce</li>
<li>1 pod of butter lettuce</li>
<li>1 pod of dragoon romain lettuce</li>
<li>1 pod of astro arugula</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll have lettuce forever. Excellent. These also grow relatively quickly, so I'll
be able to cycle through these consistently.</p>
<h3 id="variety-pack">Variety Pack<a class="headerlink" href="#variety-pack" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Variety Pack" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/variety_pack.jpg"/></p>
<p>I received a variety pack in each large box. This pack contains</p>
<ul>
<li>1 pod of little bing tomatoes</li>
<li>1 pod of dwarf blue kale</li>
<li>1 pod of swiss chard bright lights</li>
<li>1 pod of fresh bites orange peppers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basil">Basil<a class="headerlink" href="#basil" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Basil" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/basil.jpg"/></p>
<p>The last package of seeds was four pods of basil, in each large package. I'm not sure
what I'm going to do with twelve basil pods, but again, I'll figure it out.</p>
<h3 id="plant-pod">Plant Pod<a class="headerlink" href="#plant-pod" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Plant Pod" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/plant_pod.jpg"/></p>
<p>The plant seed pods fit nicely into the net cups. There are a couple seeds in
each pod.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The nurseries look easy enough to use. Select the plants I want, stick the seed pods
into a net cup and add water. Wait a week or two for sprouts and then transfer to the
garden until harvest time.</p>
<p>My only complaint about this entire round of unboxing is rather minor. Honestly, it
wouldn't even be a complaint, if I hadn't received the variety packs of seeds. If, instead
I'd gotten just single pods of lettuce or tomato or peppers, I wouldn't have thought
of it.</p>
<p>My complaint is that I have twelve pods of basil. I don't use that much basil. A variety
pack of herbs would have been awesome.</p>
<p>But, as I said, very minor complaint. I will figure out what to do with some fresh basil.
I have family members that will probably be happy to get some.</p>
<p>All in all, the nurseries look good. The seeds look good. The tiny little gardener in
me is ready to see if I can grow something.</p>
<p>With another unboxing complete, I am ready to start assembling the garden. My next post
will cover <a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html">assembly of the garden</a>.</p>
