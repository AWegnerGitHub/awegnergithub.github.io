&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html"&gt;I ran for moderator&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow and didn't make it through the primaries. That's ok though, there were several very good users that did get &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/6"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt;. In a surprise announcement, though, Stack Overflow is running a second election this year. This is the first time this has happened since 2011. I'm still interested in a position and I'm still active in the community, so I'm going to run again. This post will follow the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last time, the nomination phase began with users throwing their hat into the ring. Nominations were slower and fewer this time. Only 19 nominees, so no one was eliminated due to low reputation. Several users from the last election are rerunning too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-platform"&gt;My Platform&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-platform" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/7#post-33617646"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; hasn't changed much since the previous run. Below is my nomination post. This time, I tried to pull emphasis off the automated script by putting it lower on the list of things I've done and instead focused on the moderation tasks I do on Stack Overflow and the work I've done on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;. We'll see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, I'm &lt;strong&gt;Andy&lt;/strong&gt; and I'd make a great moderator for Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-vote-for-me"&gt;Why vote for me?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-vote-for-me" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm active in the review queues (currently holding 10th in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/stats"&gt;Low Quality Post reviewers&lt;/a&gt; of all time), provide edits to posts, &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=answers"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the moderation aspect of Stack Exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;CommunityBuilding&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a year and a half. I know the moderator tools and have worked with several of the current moderators. This interaction will continue as a new moderator here. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've built an automated script that continues to handle &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;noisy comments&lt;/a&gt; very &lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GK32p.png"&gt;accurately&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; on Meta.SO that shows I'm involved in the meta aspect of the site as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a history of good community moderation already. I enjoy the moderation aspect on Stack Overflow (and Stack Exchange in general). I deal with users with respect, even if our opinions on an issue differ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I received my "candidate score". It was 33/40. Not the highest, but better than last time. The score wasn't mentioned in April. I am not expecting it to be an issue this time either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/november_2015_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated November 21, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary phase is in the third day. In day 1, I was hovering around 9th/10th place. Overnight, between days 1 and 2 though, I dropped down to 11th. I've been sitting here consistantly for a full day now and, while still gaining votes, I'm not gaining as fast as 10th position. It appears I may not make the cutoff by Friday's deadline. While disappointing, there are a few things that I came away with that I'm very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last primary, I revieved 1,492 positive votes. I've surpassed that already. I've over 2,100 currently. I'm pleased with that upswing. I was also more prepared for the questionnaire portion of the primaries this time. I've gotten the second highest number of upvotes on my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/310357/189134"&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the questions were similar to last time, but there are a few that I think should be included in the future elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="questionnaire"&gt;Questionnaire&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#questionnaire" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first question is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; post for candidates. It allows them to show off their involvement in Meta and show their best work. For users, it gives them a sense of how a candidate interacts with the community. I am very surprised that several candidates list only one or two posts. This seems to be doing a disservice to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Meta posts that you're particularly proud of, or that you feel best demonstrate your moderation style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm proud of several of my posts both here on Meta.SO and on other network sites I participate in. Here on MSO, I have two questions that I am proud of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;Can a machine be taught to flag comments automatically?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them"&gt;I estimate 10% of the links posted here are dead. How do we deal with them?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these, you can see that I care about quality on Stack Overflow. I've spent time analyzing the problem, as I see it, and present my findings to the community. I participated in the discussions that both posts generated and &lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQoP5.png"&gt;continue to run&lt;/a&gt; the bot to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on the network, my participation in meta has helped to shape communities. For example, on &lt;a href="http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com"&gt;Hardware Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, my meta post about &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/81/57"&gt;"What type of hardware is allowed"&lt;/a&gt; helped to set the scope of what the community accepts as on topic hardware. I've also helped to set up the &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/206/57"&gt;high quality guidelines for questions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/274/57"&gt;argued against certain types of tags&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/257/57"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these, I've presented my arguments and logic and strived to remain professional. I believe the community on HardwareRecs has seen that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;, I've been involved in many &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/users/78/andy?tab=summary"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;. I was involved in the discussions to &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/175/78"&gt;rename&lt;/a&gt; the community from Moderators.SE to CommunityBuilding.SE. I've been involved in discussions about slow &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/151/78"&gt;growth of the community&lt;/a&gt;. I've also presented &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/1274/78"&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; that go against other moderators, and walked away still feeling like a moderation team. (Go communication!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on OpenSource, I made a &lt;a href="http://meta.opensource.stackexchange.com/q/642/22"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how moderators had implemented a policy to watch the reviewers. It was similar to the long removed "flag weight" option that used to exist. I believe the post was presented in a way that questioned the decisions of the moderators, yet remained professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these meta posts, across the network, I think you can pick up on my moderation style and personality. I like data and I try to present my thoughts in a way that is understandable to all. I'm also willing to speak my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second question I struggled with for a bit. I've had ideas on how Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange could improve, but what did I want to present in this response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could add/revise one Stack Overflow policy/guideline, what would you change? Why would you change it, and what would it mean for the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to this question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of talking myself out of a position, I think more community moderation would help the problem that Stack Overflow has with scaling moderators. There are a couple areas that I think would work well in opening this to the higher reputation users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment flagging: Comments can be removed if enough users flag a comment. If not, a moderator needs to handle the flag. Instead, opening this as a review queue can remove a lot of this burden from the moderators. Users could handle all but the "Other..." flag. There may be guidance needed on the "Obsolete" one due to the difference between "obsolete comment" and "obsolete code block" differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audit Review reviews: On Stack Overflow, we get a decent number of &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/disputed-review-audits"&gt;disputed audit review&lt;/a&gt; posts on meta. There may be a way to get users with a history of passing both audits and good reviews involved in dealing with these disputed audits. The idea would be to say whether an audit is good or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes, and other areas where the community could be leveraged for moderation tasks, helps to remove the burden on moderators. Handling 2,000 (and growing) flags a day means that something needs to change. Moderators are exception handlers. They should be handling the cases that are exceptional - not comments that are no longer relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the community, this would be more &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252844/make-comment-flags-less-stupid"&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; with the moderation aspect. Users would be able to more quickly clean up a comment thread. Flag it and it appears in the review queue. From here, the moderators don't need to be involved. The downside of this is that it adds another queue for users to be involved with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="primary-results"&gt;Primary Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the primaries over, I ended with &lt;strong&gt;2483&lt;/strong&gt; positive votes. This put me in 11th place. Sadly, this was not enough to get into the election. I was 185 votes shy of over taking 10th. Good luck to the candidates that made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Live Vote Counter at the end of the Primary" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/2015-11-21_22_43_25-SO_2015_Election_Vote_Monitor.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tools that came out of this election was a way to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310694/189134"&gt;visualize&lt;/a&gt; various data points to compare candidates. I provided a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/310736/189134"&gt;couple notes about outliers&lt;/a&gt; various candidates show regarding aspects on the site. I found it interesting to see what each user had "specialized" in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election"&gt;Election&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated December 8, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election is over and the new moderators have settled in. We've had our first bout of public drama over one of these moderators actually moderating a chat room too. &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was closer to the top 10 this time, but still missed it. Even more surprising was that the user that ended up in 3rd in the primaries didn't even come close to getting elected. He was eliminated in the 5th round of final STV votes. I still think I'd make a great moderator for Stack Overflow, but I need to figure out the best way to promote myself in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>Link Analysis - Technical Explanation</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/link-analysis---technical-explanation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-10T23:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-10:link-analysis---technical-explanation.html</id><summary type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last two posts, I've discussed the number of &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;rotten links&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow and a &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;proposal to fix said links&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I'm going to discuss how I performed this analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-up"&gt;Set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-database"&gt;The database&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-database" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process began by downloading the March 2013 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange"&gt;data dump&lt;/a&gt;. I loaded the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; into a [MariaDB] instance on my local machine. This was accomplished with a very simple script and patience, as the script took a while to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;load xml local infile '/path/to/posts.xml'
into table posts
rows identified by '&amp;lt;row&amp;gt;';
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-data"&gt;The data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, the next step was selecting my random sample of data. I did this by randomly selecting 25% of the days in a year and then pulling all posts for those days across all years of Stack Overflow's existence. The Python script I used to do this was fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;random_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;total_seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;366&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dayslist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;xrange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dayslist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this run, the days that I cared about are in the &lt;code&gt;dayslist&lt;/code&gt; variable. I used that to pull questions and answers from the database that were created on that month/day combination. In the end, this resulted in just over 25% of the total posts being selected. To ensure that I could replicate the results, I also saved the dates that were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="parsing-the-data"&gt;Parsing the data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#parsing-the-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to parse out links from the data. I used the following script to extract anchor text and links from a post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;def links_in_post(post):
    """
    Returns a list of all links found
    :param posts: A list of dictionaries with a 'body' key containing HTML strings
     [
        {
            'body': "&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is HTML&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;"
        },
    ]
    :return: A list of tuples containing anchor text and URL
        [
            ('Display Text', 'http://example.com')
        ]
    """
    logging.debug("Extracting links...")
    links = []
    images = []
    regexp = "&lt;span class="ni"&gt;&amp;amp;.+?;&lt;/span&gt;"
    list_of_html = re.findall(regexp, post)
    for e in list_of_html:
        if e in invalid_entities:
            h = HTMLParser.HTMLParser()
            unescaped = h.unescape(e) 
            post = post.replace(e, unescaped)

    doc = html.fromstring(post)
    for link in doc.xpath('//a'):
        links.append(Link(text=link.text_content(), link=link.get('href')))
    for image in doc.xpath('//img'):
        images.append(Link(text=image.get('alt'), link=image.get('src')))
    all_items = links + images
    seen = set()
    unique_items = [item for item in all_items if item[1] not in seen and not seen.add(item[1])]
    return unique_items
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular expression being utilized, is to strip out HTML entities. This was needed due to weird parsing issues with non-ASCII characters. Fortunately, I wasn't the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13939198/189134"&gt;first to encounter oddities like this&lt;/a&gt;. The list comprehension at the end of the function is returning only unique tuples of anchor text/link. I was surprised how often I'd end up with tuples such as &lt;code&gt;('this', 'http://google.com')&lt;/code&gt; in the same post. This uniqueness saved a lot of processing time later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all links in a post had been extracted, this information and information about the post itself, was saved to the database. If a post had no links, it was not saved. The database consisted of three tables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links - This table contains the base URLs seen in all posts. URLs are distinct. It also contains an ID that will be utilized for linking to the other tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post Links - This table contains information about links in a post. This includes the specific anchor text/link combinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link Results - This table contains the results of link status checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing the posts was fairly time consuming, but was able to be parallelized easily. That significantly cut down on processing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="checking-the-links"&gt;Checking the links&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#checking-the-links" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most time consuming portion of this entire project was actually checking link status. Each link that appeared in the &lt;code&gt;Links&lt;/code&gt; table was checked. As I mentioned in my first post, the original idea was to simply send a &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request to each URL. The idea was to save myself and the end point a tiny amount of bandwidth. I had over a million links to process. I figured a little saved bandwidth wouldn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turns out this isn't a good idea. When I started seeing larger sites as not being accessible, I go suspicious that something was wrong. These sites were returning status 405 errors. This indicates that the method is not allowed. So, I switched to &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; for every link. The next problem I ran into was that many sites didn't like the default user agent of the spider. They rejected requests with 404 and 401 errors. In the end, I got around this by mimicking Firefox on every request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those kinks worked out, every link was sent a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request that looked to be from a Firefox browser. The process would allow 20 seconds per link. If the link didn't respond in that time limit, it was declared inaccessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, I repeated the process with anything that hadn't returned a status code less than 400. Once more, on the third week, I repeated this with the failed links. At the end of three weeks, I had a list of sites that were inaccessible to me - on a residential connection - three times over a period of three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"&gt;SVG image&lt;/a&gt; that I created for the write up was generated with Pygal. The tables were the result of various break downs of the data via queries to the status results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up"&gt;Wrap up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#wrap-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rather proud of how the results turned out for this project. I went into it expecting about 15% of links to be broken, but I didn't really realize what the meant. Fifteen percent of 21 million total posts is over 3 million. That's a large number. BUT, it also ignored that a large percentage of posts don't contain links. I failed to consider that in my original hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than half of my sample had links (2.3M out of 5.6M). Of the 2.3M with links, only 1.5M were unique links. The final result of 10% failed links makes much more sense in this context. Ten percent of 1.5M links means that there are 150K links that are bad. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>A proposal to fix broken links on Stack Overflow</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-07T07:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-07:a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This post was &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on August 7th, 2015. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; about how many links on Stack Overflow are starting to rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-proposal"&gt;The proposal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-proposal" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301002/189134"&gt;another hybrid&lt;/a&gt; of the previous &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224895/what-happened-to-the-broken-link-review-queue"&gt;broken link&lt;/a&gt; queue (as was mentioned &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them#comment229798_300916"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them#comment229795_300916"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/300998/189134"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/300996/189134"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;) and an automated process to fix broken links with an archived version (which has also been &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301001/189134"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broken link queue should focus on editing and fixing the links in a post (as opposed to closing it). It'd be similar to the suggested edits queue, but with the focus intended to correct &lt;em&gt;links&lt;/em&gt; not spelling and grammar. This could be done by only allowing a user to edit the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility, I envision is presenting the user with the links in the post and a status on whether or not the link is available. If it's not available, give the user a way to change that specific link. Utilizing &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2054063/189134"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, I have a quick mock up of what I propose such a review task looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-queue"&gt;The Queue&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-queue" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenlinkqueue.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Broken Link Mock up" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenlinkqueue.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the links that appear in the post are on the right hand side of the screen. The links that are accessible have a green check mark. The ones that are broken (and the reason for being in this queue) have a red X. When a user elects to fix a post, they are presented with a modal showing only the broken URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-automation"&gt;The Automation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-automation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this queue, though, I think an automated process would be helpful as well. The idea is that this would operate similarly to the Low Quality queue, where the system can automatically add a post to the queue if certain criteria are met &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a user can flag a post as having broken links. I've based my idea on what Tim Post outlined in the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130398/does-stack-exchange-crawl-websites/198357#comment741544_198357"&gt;comments to a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated process performs a "Today in History" type check. This keeps the fixes limited to a small subset of posts per day. It also focuses on older posts, which were more likely to have a broken link than something posted recently. Example: On July 31, 2015, the only posts being checked for bad links would be anything posted on July 31 in any year 2008 through current year - 1. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing the &lt;a href="http://archive.org/about/wayback_api.php"&gt;Wayback Machine API&lt;/a&gt;, or similar service, the system attempts to change broken links into an archived version of the URL. This archived version should probably be from "close" to the time the post was originally made. If the automated process isn't able to find an archived version of the link, the post should be tossed into the Broken Link queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Community edits a post to fix a link, a new Post History event is utilized to show that a link was changed. This would allow anyone looking at revision history to easily see that a specific change was only to fix links. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions performed in the previous bullets are exposed to 10K users in the moderator tools. Much like recent close/delete posts show up, these do as well. This allows higher rep users to spot check (if they so desire). I think this portion is important when the automated process fixes a link. For community edits in the queue, the history tab in &lt;code&gt;/review&lt;/code&gt; seems sufficient. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a post consists of a large percentage of a link (or links) and these links were changed by Community, the post should have further action taken on it in some queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:
     - A post where X+% of the text is hyperlinks is very dependant on the links being active. If one or more of the links are broken, the post may no longer be relevant (or may be a link only post). One example I found while doing this was &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/4906230/revisions"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this type of edit from the Community user should bump a post to the front page. Edits done in the broken link queue, though, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; bump the post just like a suggested edit does today. By preventing the automated Community posts from being bumped, we prevent the the front page from being flooded, daily, with old posts and these edits. I think that the exposure in the 10K tools and the broken link queue will provide the visibility needed to check the process is working correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="process-flows"&gt;Process flows&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#process-flows" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queue Flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenqueueflow.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Queue Flow" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenqueueflow.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="potential-pitfalls"&gt;Potential pitfalls&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#potential-pitfalls" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated link checking will likely run into several of the problems I did. Mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites modify the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request to send a 404 instead of a 405. My solution to this was to issue &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests for everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites don't like certain user agents. My solution to this was to mimic the Firefox user agent. To be a good internet citizen, Stack Exchange probably shouldn't go that far, but providing a unique user agent that is easily identifiable as "StackExchangeBot" (think "GoogleBot"), should be helpful in identifying where traffic is coming from. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites that are down one week and up another. I solved this by spreading my tests over a period of 3 weeks. With the queue and automatic linking to an archived version of the site, this may not be necessary. However, immediately converting a link to an archived copy should be discussed by the community. Do we convert the broken link immediately? Or do we try again in X days. If it's still down then convert it? It was suggested in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301002/189134"&gt;another answer&lt;/a&gt; that we first offer the poster the chance to make changes before an automatic process takes place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to throttle requests so that you don't flood a site with requests. I solved this by only querying unique URLs. This still issues a lot of requests to certain, popular, domains. This could be solved by staggering the checks over a period of minutes/hours versus spewing 100s - 1000s of &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests at midnight daily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the broken link queue, I feel the first two would be acceptable. Much like posts in the Low Quality queue appear because of a heuristic, despite not being low quality, links will be the same way. The system will flag them as broken and the queue will determine if that is true (if an archived version of the site can't be found by the automated process). The bullet about throttling requests is an implementation detail that I'm sure the developers would be able to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Analysis of links posted to Stack Overflow</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-06:analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">

so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Approximately 10% of 1.5M randomly selected unique links in the March 2015 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange"&gt;data dump&lt;/a&gt; are unavailable. To be more precise, that is approximately 150K dead links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running into more and more links that are dead on Stack Overflow and it's bothering me. In some cases, I've spent the time hunting down a replacement, in others I've notified the owner of the post that a link is dead, and (more shamefully), in others I've simply ignored it and left just a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/262040/189134"&gt;down vote&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously that's not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making sweeping generalizations that there are dead links everywhere, though, I wanted to make sure I wasn't just finding bad posts because I was wandering through the review queues. Utilizing the March 2015 data dump, I randomly selected about 25% of the posts (both questions and answers) and then parsed out the links. This works out to 5.6M posts out of 21.7M total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these 5.6M posts, 2.3M contained links and 1.5M of these were unique links. I sent each unique URL a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods"&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; request, with a user agent mimicking Firefox&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. I then retested everything that didn't return a successful response a week later. Finally, anything that failed from &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; batch, I resent a final test a week later. If a site was down in all three tests, I considered it down for this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results2"&gt;Results&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results2" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-status-code"&gt;By status code&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-status-code" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news/Bad News: A majority of the links returned a valid response, but there are still roughly 10% that failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="PIE CHART IMAGE" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(This image is showing the top status codes returned)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three largest slices of the pie are the status 200s (site working!), status 404 (page not found, but server responded saying the page isn't found) and Connection Errors. Connection errors are sites that had no proper server response. The request to access the page timed out. I was generous in the time out and allowed a request to live for 20 seconds before failing a link with this status. The &lt;code&gt;4xx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5xx&lt;/code&gt; errors are status codes that fall in the 400 and 500 range of HTTP responses. These are client and server error ranges, thus counted as a failure. &lt;code&gt;2xx&lt;/code&gt; errors (of which was are in the low triple) are pages that responded with a success message in the 200 range, but it wasn't a &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; code. Finally, there were just over a hundred sites that hit a redirect loop that didn't seem to end. These are the &lt;code&gt;3xx&lt;/code&gt; errors. I failed a site with this range if it redirected more than 30 times. There are a negligible number of sites that returned status codes in the 600 and &lt;a href="https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc"&gt;700&lt;/a&gt; range&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-most-common"&gt;By most common&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-most-common" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, expectedly, many URLs that failed that appeared frequently in the sample set. Below is a list of the top 50&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; URLs that are in posts most often, but failed three times over the course of three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do with all of this? How do we, as a community, solve the issue of 10% of our outbound links pointing to places on the internet that no longer exist? Assuming that my sample was indicative of the entire data dump, there are close to 600K (150K broken unique links x 4, because I took 1/4 of the data dump as a sample) broken links posted in questions and answers on Stack Overflow. I assume a large number of links posted in comments would be broken as well, but that's an activity for another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage posters to provide snippets from their links just in case a link dies. That definitely helps, but the resources behind the links and the (presumably) expanded explanation behind the links are still gone. How can we properly deal with this? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like there have been a few previous discussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/198357/186281"&gt;Utilize the Wayback API to automatically fix broken links.&lt;/a&gt; Development appeared to stall on this due to the large number of edits the Community user would be making. This would also hide posts that depended on said link from being surfaced for the community to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224895/what-happened-to-the-broken-link-review-queue"&gt;Link review queue&lt;/a&gt;. It was in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212023/where-can-i-access-the-link-validation-review-queue"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;, but disappeared in early 2014. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#footnotes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how it ultimately played out. Originally I sent &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; requests, in an effort to save bandwidth. This turned out to waste a whole bunch of time because there are a whole bunch of sites around the internet that return a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error"&gt;&lt;code&gt;405 Method Not Allowed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when sending a &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request. The next step was to sent &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests, but utilize the default Python &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; user-agent. A lot of sites were returning &lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; responses to this user agent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to Stack Exchange sites were not counted in the above results. The failures seen are almost 100% due to a question/answer/comment being deleted. The process ran as an anonymous user, thus didn't have any reputation and was served a 404. A user with appropriate permissions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still visit the link. I verified a number of 404'd links to Stack Overflow posts and this was the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4th most common failure was to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. The 16th and 17th most common were &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; on ports other than 80. I removed these from the result table with the knowledge that these shouldn't be accessible from the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There where 7 total URLs that returned status codes in the &lt;code&gt;600&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc"&gt;&lt;code&gt;700&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; range. One such site was &lt;a href="http://learn.code.org/hoc/1"&gt;code.org&lt;/a&gt; with a status code of 752. Sadly, this is not even defined the joke RFC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a proposal on how I think this could be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>How I set up this site with GitHub Pages and CloudFlare</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-09T11:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-07-09:how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html</id><summary type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I described why I moved from Wordpress to Pelican for my blog. This one goes a step further and describes how I eliminated the 
need for the dedicated server I'd been utilizing as a part of &lt;a href="|filename|2015_01_08_thanks-for-all-the-fish.md"&gt;Team Vipers&lt;/a&gt;. By eliminating that server, I reduced my costs to zero but kept control 
over the DNS of my domain (thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;) and had an easier method of updating the site using &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-pages-setup"&gt;GitHub Pages Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#github-pages-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize GitHub Pages, I needed to create a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that followed the format &lt;code&gt;GitHubUsername.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. This repository would house the 
content that is this site. I also set up a second &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; which contains the source for the blog. This repository includes the templates, plugins
and markdown version of the pages. The first repository was set up as submodule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io.git output
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignored the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; on the source repository. Finally, I had to adjust &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; slightly to  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = False
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this, I was constantly destroying the output repository and had to reinitialize it. This prevents that from occuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a new post consists of writing up the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/master/content/2015_07_09_how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.md"&gt;Markdown page&lt;/a&gt;, generating the page with the command below (or the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/generate_content_production.bat"&gt;batch script&lt;/a&gt;) and then committing and
pushing the changes to the submodule to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;# Generates HTML files without debugging information
pelican content --output output --settings publishconf.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new content is available immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="custom-domain"&gt;Custom Domain&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#custom-domain" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the URL for this site isn't &lt;code&gt;awegnergithub.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, but instead &lt;code&gt;andrewwegner.com&lt;/code&gt;. To accomplish this, I added a directory to the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;
named &lt;code&gt;extra&lt;/code&gt;. In this directory is a single file named &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/content/extra/CNAME"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (no extension). In the file is my domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I had to modify &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/pelicanconf.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to add the &lt;code&gt;extra/CNAME&lt;/code&gt; to the static path and then on generation move the &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; file from this subdirectory to the root.
I could have put it in the root of &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; by default, but Pelican provides a way to do this and it keeps &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; clean. &lt;strong&gt;One very important note&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;EXTRA_PATH_METADATA&lt;/code&gt; is
operating system sensitive. Since I am generating the content on a Windows machine, I had to use a backslash instead of the forward slash the documentation shows. I found this
after posing a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30512242/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow on why it wasn't working as the documentation suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two important fields to add or edit are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;...
STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'extra/CNAME']
...
EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {'extra\CNAME': {'path': 'CNAME'},}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cloudflare-setup"&gt;Cloudflare Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#cloudflare-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thing I needed in order to get rid of my server was control over DNS. I could revert back to GoDaddy, but after a little research found that CloudFlare's additional CDN and 
security was a "good thing" (because, you know, I'm such a highly traffic'd blog these days). Step one was signing up to CloudFlare. This was a 3-5 minute thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once signed up and signed in, I went to set up DNS. This was as simple as adding my domain name and waiting for CloudFlare to import my existing DNS records. With this, I kept by Google Apps
email intact (which is what I was most concerned with). Next, I went and removed the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; records. I replaced these with &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; records pointing to my GitHub Pages URL. I also added a &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; CNAME 
pointing to the same location. Since I have Pelican configured to strip it with the setting below, it doesn't matter other than people expect to enter &lt;code&gt;www dot domain dot com&lt;/code&gt; in their URL bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;SITEURL = 'http://andrewwegner.com'
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, I had to point by name servers to CloudFlare instead of my dedicated server. They provide a list of registratars to choose from. Select your registrar and follow the instructions. My biggest
issue here was remembering my GoDaddy password. After I made it into my account, the steps to change name servers were very simple. Once those are saved, you wait for the changes to propagate and
enjoy your new GitHub Pages / CloudFlare web page for free. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Meta"></category><category term="technical"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I moved from Wordpress to Pelican</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-03T22:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-05-03:why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I maintained a Wordpress blog covering various things I've done or created. Most of these revolved around
things I created to make administering Team Vipers easier for me and for the rest of the admin team. It was my way
of documenting what I'd done (in case I ever needed to do it again) and providing a way to update the Team Vipers community
about new plugins or applications that would be deployed to the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-issues-with-wordpress"&gt;My Issues with Wordpress&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-issues-with-wordpress" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I had with Wordpress was that it was just to bulky for the simple posts I was making. I needed a database, a full web
server (or a hosting provider), and either time to hunt for the "perfect" plugin(s) or PHP knowledge to do it myself. Early in my
development career, I used PHP a lot. That was part of the reason I chose Wordpress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! I know that language. If I ever need something, I can just whip it up myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Me, before the real world ambushed me and beat me with a stick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="spam"&gt;Spam&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent time setting up Wordpress. I picked out a theme, plugins, and started saving future me with documentation. Then life happened. For whatever
reason, I stopped updating Wordpress. My blog sat out there for weeks or months unvisited by anyone. Then, one morning, my phone vibrated
and told me that I had a new comment on my site. Woo! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was spam. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I marked it spam and moved on with my day. Later that morning, I glanced at my phone again. 32 emails. I am just not that popular. Something
was wrong. Turns out, a spam bot found me. I sighed and then removed all the comments and checked the box indicating that users had to
be registered to post. That solved my problem for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the bots got smarter. They started registering. They started posting legitimate looking messages, except for that associated URL their name
would link to in the comments. They pulled keywords out of the post and formulated a somewhat passable English question using those words. The spam
prevention plugins I installed would slow the tide for a few weeks. The bots would adapt and then I'd be awash with spam posts again. Eventually,
the solution was to completely disable comments. I'd spent way to much time dealing with spam on a blog that received very little legitimate traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't utilize the comments, Pelican provides a nice simple page that I can post my thoughts and not worry about getting hit by a spam bot. It also
provides plugins so that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include comments should I ever choose to do so in the future. For the time being, though, I have a nice simple page 
with no comments. That's exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="security"&gt;Security&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch any technology web sites, you'll notice that there are vulnerabilities found in Wordpress frequently. These require patches,
which requires me to do something. It may be as simple as logging in and clicking a button to update, but it is still something I need to 
remember to do for a relatively minor site. When I'd log in to clear the spam backlog, I'd frequently also install updates for 10-20 plugins, themes or
Wordpress itself. It was mostly painless, but I didn't like the idea of the site sitting there vulnerable for weeks at a time because I didn't
visit and login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of Wordpress and the underlying database exposed a fairly sizable target for a web page so small. Pelican generates static
HTML pages. I don't have to worry about SQL injections, unauthorized logins, or anything else. I host a basic set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 
That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="php-vs-python"&gt;PHP vs Python&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#php-vs-python" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I used to use PHP frequently. It was my go to language. I picked Wordpress with the idea that I'd be able to hack together features I needed.
The reality, it turns out, was that I wasn't actually interested in doing that. Instead, I picked out plugins that were close enough to the
exact functionality I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I transferred to a job where I used Python. Instead of having a language I used on the side (PHP) and a job where I was a glorified project manager, without the 
actual title of "Project Manager", I now had a job where I used a language (Python) for 8 hours a day. My usage of PHP plummeted. I found I could get what I wanted
done in my side projects faster and easier with Python. At work I used Python to build tools for engineering problems. At home, I started using it for every day
tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I realized I hadn't used PHP for several versions of the language. My knowledge of the language was outdated. The biggest reason I'd chosen Wordpress was no longer
relevant, because I couldn't write anything complicated in PHP without glancing at documentation to do even simple things. It's sad that I lost the intimate knowledge of
a language, but I feel that I've been more productive with Python anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is written in Python. Even more importantly though, it generates HTML files which are hosted. I don't need to run a Python environment on a server. I just
need to host HTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#markdown" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've fought with Wordpress's text editor countless times. This happened most often when attempting to add code blocks. It was a pain to do. It was a pain
to fix when the blocks broke. Pelican supports Markdown. Markdown is supported by large organizations like GitHub, reddit and Stack Exchange. I use all three of those.
I know how to utilize Markdown to create code blocks, headers, insert images, create bulleted lists. All without needing to fight how the text editor is going to actually
save the data.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Meta"></category><category term="Pelican"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm running to be a moderator of Stack Overflow</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-04-06:i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#"&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; has over 130 sites in its network. Each of those sites has at least 3 moderators that are glorified &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;janitors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the moderation work is extremely mundane, almost janitorial. It’s deleting obvious spam, closing blatantly off-topic questions, and culling some of the worst rated posts in various dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal moderator does as little as possible. But those little actions may be powerful and highly concentrated. Judiciously limiting your use of moderator powers to selectively prune and guide the community — now that’s the true art of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works so well in the Stack Exchange network because the users are able to handle most moderation tasks. As users gain reputation, they gain privileges. With these privileges, they are better able to maintain and cultivate the content on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all activity can be performed by users though. This is where moderators come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/users/78/andy?tab=profile"&gt;&lt;img alt="Andy on Community Building" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/community_building_andy_flair.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have a diamond (♦) on the &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt; site. I was &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/138/78"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; one of the Pro Tempore moderators during the beta phase of the site. This is my first experience moderating on Stack Exchange, beyond what my reputation on Stack Overflow
gets me. &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/77/78"&gt;It is not, however, my first time moderating&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Community Building&lt;/em&gt; is focused on various aspects of building communities - both online and off. It caters to users from all aspects of a site (owners, moderators, users, advertisers and any thing else).
My experience here led me to pursuing a moderator position on Stack Overflow. This site is orders of magnitude larger than &lt;em&gt;Community Building&lt;/em&gt;. It has millions of users and millions of questions. With all this traffic, there are still only 18 diamond moderators. The
idea of community moderation shows that it scales well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election cycle begins with the nomination phase. Users nominate themselves for the position. In 1200 characters or less, you lay out your platform. In this phase, nearly anyone can nominate themselves. However, there are only 30 positions available. If more than 30 people
nominate themselves, then the users with the lowest reputation get bumped. With only 11K reputation, I am at the lower end of the spectrum of other nominees, but I am well above the lowest. I have the 8th lowest reputation. I've looked at previous election cycles. It seems unlikely
that there will be 30 or more nominees. I think that I am safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-platform"&gt;My Platform&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-platform" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted my &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/6#post-29480018"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the nomination phase opened. I stressed the work that I've already done on Stack Overflow and previous moderation experience on another Stack Exchange site (Community Building).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Andy and I want to be one of your moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why vote for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've built an automated script to handle &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;noisy comments&lt;/a&gt;. It runs daily, probably to the chagrin of the current moderators, but it helps keep the comments noise down and it is incredibly accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the automated flagging, I participate in the review queues, provide edits and post &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=answers"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a moderator of &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;"Community Building"&lt;/a&gt;, I know the tools used by the Stack Exchange sites. I've used this position to interact with the existing moderators for advise and questions. This interaction will not only continue but be helpful as a new moderator to SO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the flagging history and experience to make the appropriate judgement calls. I feel that is a positive attribute that will help me in helping you to have the best experience you can on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll continue to help improve the site regardless of whether I am elected or not. I will be able to do a much better job at that, though, as one of your moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I received my "candidate score". It was 29/40. Not the highest, but not the lowest either. I expect, if any one is concerned about this score, it will be mentioned it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 11, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments on my nomination post have focused mostly on the pros and cons of the automated script I built to flag comments. I was expecting this discussion. I'd classify most of the comments about the script as
"cautious". Users seem concerned about something completely automated used to moderate or that I focus on low priority content. My response to this concern was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] by automating the removal of this lower priority content it is easier to focus on the actively harmful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to point out that I have done more than "build a script". I've actively participated in review queues on Stack Overflow for years. I've flagged appropriate content
(with a high percentage marked as accepted). I have also been moderator on Community Building. All of this, in combination with the automation, makes up my "platform".
I have the experience of moderation, the knowledge of how the system works and the drive to improve the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also mentioned a few times that I'd be unlikely to utilize such an automated tool as a moderator. I promised to bring this concern up when I moved further into the election process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I received a few comments supporting either me or the work that I've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automation is very impressive - thanks for that, it's a real contribution to the quality of the site. That said - as a privileged user I suspect you won't be able to run these sort of scripts on your account for obvious reasons.  –  Benjamin Gruenbaum Apr 6 at 21:34&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can vouch for Andy's track record as a pro tem mod on Community Building. I want to note as well for the record that many of the main site questions and answers on Community Building are explicitly about moderation, and his contributions there also provide insight into his approach to the job. –  Air Apr 7 at 16:54&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh. I have to say I'm impressed. Putting you on my list of candidates to watch. –  Qix Apr 7 at 19:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to point out that your response to my concerns is fair and reasonable, as well as polite, even if it isn't quite exactly how I see things. It certainly alleviates my concerns of misusing moderator power. I will be seriously considering voting for you. –  jpmc26 Apr 8 at 6:41&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm pleased with how the discussion has gone. It has been a few days since there were comments left though. Hopefully a little interest picks up during the primary phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very impressed by the other candidates. There are many very good candidates that I'd be happy to work with (or be unashamed to lose to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 17, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nomination phases has ended. I have advanced to the primary phase. The purpose of this phase is to narrow the list of 30 candidates to 10. Those 10 will be the ones that can be voted on to be the next moderators. In the primary phase, users can vote nominees up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the election process, one of the other &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/616460/jason-c"&gt;candidates&lt;/a&gt; created several tools to help users see nominee activity. He also created a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290346/2015-election-live-vote-monitor"&gt;live vote monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It was exciting to hang out in the Election Chat room and watch votes roll in. The position of 10th was highly contested
toward the end of the primary. I was very pleased to see that everyone remained civil in the chat room too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended this phase with &lt;strong&gt;1492&lt;/strong&gt; positive votes. This put me in 15th. Sadly, not enough to advance to the election phase. However, there are several excellent candidates that did advance. Good luck to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Live Vote Counter at the end of the Primary" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_primary_live_vote.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-primary-data"&gt;Other Primary Data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#other-primary-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the primary phase involves answering questions that users have posed during the nomination phase. These questions were voted upon and the highest were included in the questionnaire. My &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290096/2015-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire/290122#290122"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; was removed at the end of this phase because I did not advance. I was
prepared with answers about my moderation style and my expectations for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other tools that was created during this cycle showed &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289995/2015-moderator-candidate-activity-profiles"&gt;nominee activity&lt;/a&gt; on the site over time. This was a quick way to compare nominees based on the number of activities they have performed on undeleted posts (because data related to deleted posts is removed from public view). It
provided, at a glance, a way to see who is and is not active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the charts of my activity that the tool created. The green vertical bar is account creation date. The orange/brown vertical bars are previous election windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stack Overflow Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_so_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
This is my activity chart for Stack Overflow itself. It shows that I've had an account since 2009, but didn't really start utilizing the site, more than occassionally, until 2013. Since then, it shows that a large majority of my
activity onsite is in the review queues. There are posts, revisions, comments and more along the bottom, but most of my activity is in the review queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Stack Overflow Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_mso_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Meta Stack Exchange Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_mse_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
My Meta Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange charts show a fairly low activity level. Unfortunately, I think this is obscuring the posts that I do make simply because of the large scale on the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Combined Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_combined_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
Finally, the last chart shows the combined activity across all three areas (SO, MSO, and MSE). It looks very similar to the Stack Overflow one because of the lower activity levels on the two Meta sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election is over. Three great candidates were elected. One thing I am like about Stack Exchange's elections is their &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/77560/186281"&gt;usage of OpenSTV and the Meek STV method&lt;/a&gt;. The results of each round of the
election cycle are available at &lt;a href="http://www.opavote.org/results/4962933813542912/0"&gt;opavote.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most elections, there are known and unknown winners before the election even begins. The response that &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"&gt;Martijn Pieters&lt;/a&gt; received from the time he nominated through the final moments of the election all but guarenteed a victory for him. It is a
well deserved victory. I hope that he is able to keep up his frequent, high quality, answers in the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python"&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; tag. If not, his drop in activity will be felt. The surprise, to me, was &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1114/jeremy-banks"&gt;Jeremy Banks&lt;/a&gt;. He ended in 9th place in the primaries. That doesn't mean he can't do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've interacted with all three moderators on site and in chat prior to their victory. I've been very happy with those interactions. With their promotion, I look forward to working with them as a moderator on the Stack Exchange network in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been the owner of Vipers for almost 5 years. In that time I've help the community grown and get stronger. I've helped
members begin their own communities and I've maintained the game servers the players utilize 24 hours a day. I've been 
concerned about low activity, excited about new events and updates, and watched the community ebb and flow through out
the years. I've dealt with trolls, spammers, and new community members. I think I've gained valuable experience in 
managing a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also a member on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and over the years gotten to know others that enjoy the "Meta" aspect of 
Stack Exchange. That's the "behind the scenes", "how does this site work?" discussions and activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moderators"&gt;Moderators&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#moderators" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I found a way to merge my experience with Vipers and the knowledge of the Stack Exchange platform. A new 
community started recently: &lt;a href="http://moderators.stackexchange.com"&gt;Moderators&lt;/a&gt;. The idea behind this site is for people building, administering, managing or
cultivating digital communities to have a place to ask others with similar experiences questions. I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things a new site needs on the Stack Exchange network is a set of pro tempore moderators. While Stack Exchange 
believe in &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;community moderation&lt;/a&gt;, there are still some things that require more access. These pro tempore moderators
are those people. I &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/80/78"&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; myself for one such position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-nomination"&gt;The Nomination&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-nomination" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the nomination I presented to the community. In it, I discuss my experience with Vipers and some of our challenges.
One in particular that I mention is the &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html"&gt;automated language filter&lt;/a&gt; we have on the game servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an administrator/site owner of a medium sized gaming community that runs on a PHPBB3 board. We host multiple game 
servers as well. I've got a team of moderators that help keep the forum and game servers clean. I've run this site for 
5 years, after taking it over from the original creator of the community who wanted to move on. In my time as admin, 
we've seen the number of participants on the forum increase. We've seen our game server population increase as well. 
I attribute this to getting the community involved in change discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest changes occurred several years ago. Community members complained that our game servers would be over 
run with trolls at hours when moderators weren't available and spewing filth. The community wanted a cleaner game 
server experience. Users wanted these players gone immediately. Previous community leaders felt that trolling of this 
kind was part of the game and did nothing. After some discussions regarding what was and wasn't appropriate, we decided 
to be (for lack of a better term) "family friendlier". Certain 'extreme' phrases were no longer tolerated at all. A 
technical solution was built to automatically remove players that violated these rules. This solution allowed users to 
swear, but once it became excessive (again, defined by the community) they, too, were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool we have (PHPBB3) may not have the reputation, badges, or increasing privileges used here on Stack Exchange but 
for my community that has not been a negative. Engaging with the community in discussions and letting the members provide 
input that me and my team utilize has been extremely beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no experience moderating a Stack Exchange site. I don't feel that's a down side though. I can provide the 
"outside" perspective in a Stack Exchange heavy group. That does mean, though, that I'd depend on and expect the 
community to provide feedback on how moderation in being handled. Much like my existing gaming community, input from the 
community to the moderation team is important and the moderation team should be listening to that input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/138/78"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; to a moderator position on Moderators. I now "moderator the moderators", as the running joke 
has been on meta and the chatroom. I am looking forward to helping this community grow and to providing my experience 
of community management outside of Stack Exchange to this position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost since the beginning of Moderators, there have been conversations about whether the name is limiting our scope. We aren't
a community for &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; moderation questions. We are a community about how to build communities and moderation happens to
be a part of community building. (How many times can you say "community" before it sounds weird?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/140/78"&gt;Discussions&lt;/a&gt; began in August about possible name changes. These &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/175/78"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; continued into October as we worked on
the &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/172/78"&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt; of our site. Finally, on December 2, we received our new name: &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/193/78"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;. It's the same great site
but with a much more relevant name. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>I had a secret addiction to the TF2 idling economy but I'm better now (honest)</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/i-had-a-secret-addiction-to-the-tf2-idling-economy-but-i'm-better-now-(honest).html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-08-13T00:01:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2013-08-13:i-had-a-secret-addiction-to-the-tf2-idling-economy-but-i'm-better-now-(honest).html</id><summary type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11, 2013, Valve released a &lt;a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=11105"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; to Team Fortress 2 to limit idling. Idling is the process of launching
Team Fortress and then letting it run for a few hours and collecting item drops. It used to be simple to do by utilizing
the &lt;code&gt;-textmode&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_Line_Options#Command-line_parameters_2"&gt;game parameter&lt;/a&gt;. This would "launch" the game without graphics. From there, you just let it run and 
come back in a few hours with 8-10 new items (your weekly limit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this was to then trade or craft these into metal. The metal could be used to trade for keys, hats, etc. and
all you to be "rich". The quotes are there because I do realize that being rich in a virtual game does not make one rich in
the real world. But, since the &lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann-Conomy_Update"&gt;Mann-Conomy Update&lt;/a&gt; introduced this massive meta game to Team Fortress, I've tried to stay
out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed. I didn't just idle one account. I idled 17 accounts. That is between 136 and 170 items a week. That's between 68 to 85
scrap metal a week. That's between 7.55 and 9.44 refined metal a week. That is between 3 and 4 keys a week (depending on 
who I trade with). Keys are the backbone of the economy. Get enough of those and you can trade for anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't know what my goal was. I wasn't interested in the fancy hats (ooooh...shiny pixels). I didn't open crates
with the keys. I did utilize the keys to get &lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tour_of_Duty_Ticket"&gt;Tour of Duty&lt;/a&gt; tickets for me and some friends. That's honorable, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-this-happen"&gt;How did this happen?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-did-this-happen" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html"&gt;the bot I built for Vipers to handle the raffles&lt;/a&gt;. I realized that I could automate much more
than trading with players. I could automate trading between bots. I could automate &lt;em&gt;crafting&lt;/em&gt; - which is relatively time
consuming, especially when you have 136 items to go through. I could automate trading with established scrap bank bots. These
bots will take any two weapon drops and give you one scrap, even if the two items can't be crafted together. The idea is
that they get enough weapons that eventually they'll be able to craft it down to metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-set-up"&gt;The set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To idle 17 accounts I needed to figure out what my computer could handle. I had to figure out how to run multiple instances
of Steam and Team Fortress at a time. Enter an application I'd utilized before: &lt;a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/"&gt;Sandboxie&lt;/a&gt;. This application provides 
isolated sandboxes for applications to run in. Normally Steam won't run more than once on a machine. But, if you launch
it via Sandboxie, the host OS (and other Sandboxie environments) can't see that Steam is running in another instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of experiementation showed that I could handle 6 accounts idling at a time and have the computer remain just barely 
usable. I created new accounts and split them into which day of the week they'd be run. I had three days out of the week 
designated for idling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A batch script was built to launch the Sandboxie environments of the day that was to idle. Then it'd launch Team Fortress
in each of those environments. Then I'd go to bed. When I woke up the next morning, I'd shut down the environments. I'd 
repeat this for two more nights. At the end of the third night, I had all the items I could get for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts could not be free accounts. This meant that I needed to either buy an item for each account, or trade for an 
&lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Upgrade_to_Premium_Gift"&gt;"Upgrade to Premium Gift"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="getting-items-to-a-single-account"&gt;Getting items to a single account&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-items-to-a-single-account" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the process was to convert all the items to metal. Normally, this would take place by either logging into
each account and crafting there and then trading everything to a master account, or trading everything first then crafting. 
In either case, 17 accounts is a lot to handle and trading/crafting is rather boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to modify the raffle bot. I'd designate one account as a master account. This would be the account that
received items. All others would dump items to it. I'd log into the account that was receiving items and initiate a trade
with each other bot in turn. I'd issue a command &lt;code&gt;add all&lt;/code&gt; and that bot would dump it's inventory into trade. Making it
through all the bots would take 5 minutes. Previously it would take me an hour or more to log into each account and
manually add items to the trade windows and then confirm the trade on both sides. &lt;em&gt;yawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="crafting"&gt;Crafting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#crafting" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was crafting items to metal. The rule was that any two weapons utilized by the same class could be
crafted to scrap metal. That sounds simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of trial and error, I'd built a set of commands that would select compatable weapons and craft them together. This
particular aspect wasn't documented by Steam (or the revese engineered SteamKit2 library I was utilizing). Crafting would 
take about 15 seconds to get all compatible items to scrap and then combining 9 scrap to get a refined metal. This saved 
inventory space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the simple command &lt;code&gt;craftall&lt;/code&gt;, all those new weapons would be crafted into metal and then combined into refined metal. This 
would be done in less than a minute. Previously, I'd have to initiate each crafting session, add all items per craft, wait for the
craft to complete and then repeat. This was another 15-30 minutes saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="left-overs"&gt;Left overs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#left-overs" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crafting, there would still be left over weapons. There were weapons that had run out of same class items to craft
with. The solution was to trade these away in groups of two to &lt;a href="http://scrapbank.me/"&gt;ScrapBank.me&lt;/a&gt; and get scrap metal back. This could be
further combined to refined metal again wasting space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="metal-to-keys"&gt;Metal to Keys&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#metal-to-keys" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, human intervention was required again. I had to convert my metal to keys. I did this via trading. The easy
way to do this was to find someone running a keybot, that would take metal for a key. Many exist, but all of them overcharge.
The other option was to look for a trader that was getting rid of a bulk set of keys and then trade them. In either case,
I'd end the week with 3-4 keys. I'd trade these for Tour of Duty tickets and go play a game with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual work required on my part was starting the idling for the night, shutting down idling in the morning, starting
the automated trade, crafting and trade left overs processes and finally trading metal for keys. What used to take me hours 
to do each week, I could not do in less than an hour (the bulk of which ended up being trading metal for keys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-changed"&gt;What changed?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-changed" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve released a patch to limit how effective idling was. Their "Mann-Conomy" was seeing rapid inflation. The price of 
keys (which they sold for physical money) in metal was rapidly increasing. From the time I started this to the time I ended
it, it jumped from 2-3 refined per key to 9-10 per key, with no sign of stopping. Casual players were complaining they couldn't
get enough items to trade for this stuff. The patch also required that you click to confirm each new received item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="im-ok-honest"&gt;I'm ok. Honest.&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#im-ok-honest" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried for a few days to find an effective work around. I didn't. When I wasn't able to find one, I transfered all items 
to the master account and went through the process of converting to keys. With that, I purchased the final set of 
Tour of Duty tickets. The idle bots were shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a month now. The bots are still down. I'm still around. Looking back on this, I'm happy Valve broke this. It wasn't
doing anything for me other than providing me with something to do: "Need to idle tonight", "Need to craft and trade today", etc. 
Now I have that time back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased with the technical challeges I over came to get this done though. Crafting was the biggest, but I think I'm
most proud of the automated transfer of items to the master. Since the bots had to communicate via Steam and not via
a local application, working out how I was going to do that took some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, my friends, was my addiction to the meta game of a hat similator in a first person shooter. I'm over it now and 
looking forward to some other project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="automation"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="gaming"></category></entry></feed>
