&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html"&gt;last review&lt;/a&gt; covered &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/"&gt;Lazy Programmer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Numpy prerequisites course&lt;/a&gt; on Udemy. In my goal to learn more about NLP, 
I'm continuing through the courses this instructor has designed. To this end, that requires two additional prerequisites: &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-science-linear-regression-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Linear
Regression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-science-logistic-regression-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/a&gt;. This review covers those two seperate courses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two courses are each short three hour courses giving a crash course in how to perform linear regression analysis and logistic
regression analysis. The courses cover both the theorectical math needed and the more practical Python code needed. The instructor 
states, several times, that simply copying the code isn't good enough in the later courses. The mathmatical background is needed to 
succeed later. With that in mind, I spent most of these lectures relearning much of the math. The instructor provides several detailed 
"Theory" lectures and I found those helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the theory is introduced, the next step is applying this in code. The instructor's code is short and to the point. It shows the 
what was just taught and provides efficient &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; code to convert the theory into something workable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I'm happy with the instructor and their teaching style. I think this will go well with the future courses I'm planning on taking
that are by the same person. I'm continuing to brush up on those math skills that haven't been used in a while, but at this point, I am happy
with how everything is heading for this series of courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've posted my &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Deep-Learning-Prerequisites"&gt;IPython Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub for all three of the courses related to the prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still looking forward to taking the &lt;a href="https://lazyprogrammer.me/data-science-courses/"&gt;courses designed by the Lazy Programmer&lt;/a&gt;. The series of prerequisites were very helpful in helping
me to catch up on the skills I'll need, but didn't know (or remember much of) ahead of time. With the actual content coming up, I am hoping
the lecture style and hands on coding sections continue be the same quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linear and Logistic Regression courses didn't require much in terms of software - Python, numpy, pandas and matplotlib - but I still need to 
decide how I'm going to proceed with the courses. I'm not sure whether or not I want to set up a Linux machine or a virtual machine. Windows doesn't 
seem to play well with all the libraries I'll be needing. It may make my life easier too. So far, everyone seems to be using a Mac or Linux machine to
teach these courses and offer only basic "It may work on Windows" advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/"&gt;Lazy Programmer's&lt;/a&gt; Deep Learning courses on Udemy. A couple of those seem very interesting, specifically the ones 
about Natural Language Processing. I'd love to be able to enhance either my &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;comment flagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; 
with language processing capabilities. I also have tried, multiple times, to come up with a way to detect duplicate questions on
Stack Overflow, but my limited knowledge of true NLP concepts has proved to be unhelpful in that task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the goal of getting to the NLP courses and completing a few other data science and machine learning courses this year. I've
picked out a few that look interesting and useful in either personal or professional projects. That will be my main focus in the next
several months. When I need a break from these topics, I may find another soft skills course to look at. Or, I have a play through of
Witcher 3 waiting for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start this journey, I need to cover some prerequisites. Data Science and Machine learning utilize several important libraries and
I need to know them or brush up my skills when using them. I took the &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/data-analysis-with-pandas-review.html"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;/a&gt; last winter and found that helpful.
Lazy Programmer offers one covering the numpy stack. That's what I just finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python&lt;/a&gt; is a brief two hour course that gives a crash course in how to use numpy, pandas,
matplotlib and scipy. It touches each of these &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; briefly. The goal of the course isn't to get you intimately familiar with the libraries.
The goal is to get you to know the libraries exist and a few of their most common tasks. In this regard, it was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course also served as a nice introduction to the instructor and their teaching style. It is all hands on though, which I like. I prefer
to do the coding (and add my own comments along the way) to watching someone present a huge chunk of code and walk through that line by
line. I've posted my &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Deep-Learning-Prerequisites"&gt;IPython Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing this course does is introduce users to the assumptions the instructor makes about the students. Machine learning and data science,
in general, have a lot of math behind them. The instructor assumes that students have the theorectical background for this and teaches how to
implement this math in Numpy. Note to self: Brush up on those math skills. I haven't used some of this in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction course to the bigger &lt;a href="https://lazyprogrammer.me/data-science-courses/"&gt;"Deep Learning" courses&lt;/a&gt; that Lazy Programmer offers. It does it's job well and has increased my
confidence in the instructor. My last couple courses haven't been great and I'm happy that this quick two hour course was available. I'm looking 
forward to taking some more of these courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will need to consider as I go through this course: whether or not to either set up a Linux machine or a virtual machine. Windows doesn't
seem to play well with all the libraries I'll be needing. It may make my life easier too. So far, everyone seems to be using a Mac or Linux machine to
teach these courses and offer only basic "It may work on Windows" advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished the &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job/learn/v4/overview"&gt;"Become a Product Manager  | Learn the Skills &amp;amp; Get the job"&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy. I had picked
this up in December during one of Udemy's frequent $15 dollars. I was looking to take something non-technical that covers
more of the "soft skills" I utilize in my job. I do a lot of software "product manager" work, without the title, at my job
and was hoping to brush up on those skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is billed as a 13 hour course, with activities and interviews with product managers. The course is taught by 
Cole Mercer (a Senior product manager at &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;) and Evan Kimbrell (founder of &lt;a href="http://www.sprintkick.com/"&gt;Sprintkick&lt;/a&gt;). The course is 
packed with useful content, resources and interviews. I learned a lot and reinforced a lot of what I already knew. That 
information will be incredibly useful at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That glowing review said, I had a hard time getting through the lessons. Despite the amount of useful information, I found 
the lessons to be...boring, at best. At worst, the instructors attempted to throw jokes in that just didn't work for this format.
That type of distraction made it hard to stick with the lessons. Additionally, the quizzes that cropped up occassionally, were 
treated as a joke by the course creators. There were joke answers, there were joke explanations for answers and their were 
questions unrelated to the content but instead about the instructors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are several points in the lessons that ask students to go the message board and provide feedback, do a quick activity,
and interact with one another. I did a couple of these. I stopped doing them when I didn't receive any responses from either other
students or the instructors. A closer look at the message board shows this is very common. I have to scroll back through a couple 
"load more" clicks on the message board to find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; posts that even have a response. The interaction I was hoping for from the 
instructors just doesn't exist with this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content in this course is amazingly helpful. There are links to articles that I'll be able to use for years. The information
in the lectures is also helpful, if you can get through the bland presentation of the material. The frequent, distracting, jokes and 
lack of interaction makes this course less stellar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'd consider this a middle of the road course. The presentation is what drags down this information packed course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to squeeze one more course in before 2016 ended. This time I chose 
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/from-0-1-machine-learning/learn/v4/overview"&gt;"From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase"&lt;/a&gt; by the LoonyCorn team on Udemy. This course was
a 20 hour overview of machine learning techniques. I've been interested in taking some more formal training on various
machine learning algorithms and this course sounded like it would be useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very disappointed in this course. The lessons had large portions of time that overlapped one another, the 
background music was distracting, the instructor's speaking volume isn't consistent, the "coding" portions weren't
done in a way that allowed me to follow along, code was presented with bugs and the instructor glossed over
these with a simple "we'll fix those later". The theories were presented fairly well but really should have been
condensed into a handful of lessons instead of spread out so broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few lessons to realize it, but the course notes - effectively power point slides that are hand written 
during the lecture - and the instructor's voice were recorded at different times. Multiple times through the lessons,
the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same portion is used repeatedly. Lecture notes are "rewritten" or explained again. This repetition is used
ineffectively, as the instructor's voice isn't consistent within a single lecture. The repeated parts are either much
louder or much softer than the surrounding lecture material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest disappointment, though, was with the coding exercises. I was hoping for some hands on activities. Instead,
the instructor spoke while the code - with all comments - was coded "live". The code was done quickly and offered no time
for me to both code and listen to the explanation. Like the lecture notes, the code and the vocal explanation was
recorded at different times. This means when a bug is encountered in the code, it is simply glossed over in the
explanation as an area they will return to later to fix. This was incredibly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course wasn't worth my time. The theory portions were &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; good enough that I stuck with it hoping to pick out
something useful, but it never seemed to materialize. I did complete the course and don't feel I've learned anything
that I can apply elsewhere. In the new year, I'll be looking for another machine learning course that, hopefully, is
much better than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a few years since I finished my formal education. I've been getting the itch to take a few more structured 
training courses, but don't have the desire to commit to another full university degree. Fortunately, there are a lot 
of places online that now offer training and college courses (both free and paid). I'll be picking out a few and going 
through them as my free time permits. I'll be sharing my thoughts on the courses in a series of posts with a review of 
the course and, if available, a link to show what I produced during the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-analysis-with-pandas"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#data-analysis-with-pandas" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;/a&gt; by Boris Paskhaver on Udemy. I use pandas both at work and in 
personal projects and constantly find new things the library can do. This course is billed as a 19 hour course spanning 
173 lectures. The curriculum looked like it covered both basics and topics I was less familiar with. It also helped 
that the instructor was offering a coupon code on reddit to take the course for free. I decided to take the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler&lt;/em&gt;: Even if this wasn't free, this class was worth the price. It covered a large part of pandas and did so in a 
way that didn't make me tune out the instructor, even after 19 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course starts a bit slow with your basic "How to install" tutorials. The entire course is done in a series of 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Data-Analysis-with-Pandas"&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; and, obviously, requires that you have Python (the instructor uses 3.5), pandas and a few 
other modules installed before we get to the good stuff. The instructor uses OS X during all lectures, but that has 
no effect on how things are communicated to the student. Everything is done in the Jupyter Notebooks or at a &lt;a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"&gt;conda&lt;/a&gt; 
prompt. This works the same across all major operating systems. The only reason I felt this was slow was because I 
already had all of the requirements installed due to using the library before. I understand the need for this lesson, 
though, and can't hold it against the instructor for needing to include this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I liked about the introduction was that the instructor provided a series of CSV files we'd use 
throughout the rest of the lessons. These CSVs were varied in size and composition. I thought this was a great way to 
keep everyone on the same page. I've seen a lot of tutorials on pandas around the internet and most of them depend on 
generating random data. By providing everyone with a set of CSVs it is much easier to focus on specific aspects of the 
data and how certain functions work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="series-and-dataframes"&gt;Series and DataFrames&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#series-and-dataframes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course really begins in Section 2 which is on the pandas &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html"&gt;Series&lt;/a&gt; object. It covers what a series is, various 
methods of creating one, and then goes over the various methods and attributes you can use on a series object. The 
module covers 21 lessons and lays the foundation for the entire pandas library. Section 3, 4, and 5 cover 
&lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html"&gt;DataFrames&lt;/a&gt;. These sections cover 41 lessons. DataFrames are the heart of the pandas library. This is the object 
you'll use most of the time, which explains the number of lessons that focus on DataFrames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lessons cover everything from selecting a series (column) in a data frame, adding a new column, dropping null 
values and sorting values. More advanced topics include various ways of filtering a dataframe to only the data you are 
interested in, applying a function to all values and working with either index labels or index positions. These modules 
are the heart of the entire course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="text-data-and-datetime-data"&gt;Text data and DateTime data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#text-data-and-datetime-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 6 and 10 deal with text data and datetime data. One complaint I had about these two sections was that they 
were separated so much. Both types of data need to be operated on the same way in pandas. Namely, you have to add 
either &lt;code&gt;.str&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.dt&lt;/code&gt; when calling a string or datetime function. I also think that datetimes are important enough 
and used frequently enough that getting a lesson in on how to properly use them early would make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That complaint aside, both sections cover their content well. There isn't anything ground breaking here, especially 
if you've done any sort of work with either strings or dates in Python. The functions introduced all work as you'd 
expect based on that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DateTime section also provides information on how to work with date offsets and time deltas. Adding and 
subtracting days/weeks/months is always important and the lessons cover how to do so pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="advanced-features"&gt;Advanced Features&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-features" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 7, 8 and 9 cover aspects of pandas that many will use as well. These cover ways to join and group multiple data 
sets into a single data frame and the benefits of each method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MultiIndexes are not something I've used a lot, but after these 14 lessons I have already thought of ways I can 
improve my code at work to utilize these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="panels"&gt;Panels&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#panels" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 11 covers a topic that was brand new to me: Panels. I have never used them or heard of them. A series is a 1D 
dataset, a dataframe is a 2D dataset and a panel is a 3D dataset. It is a group of dataframes. The instructor explained 
this concept very clearly and worked through multiple examples of how to build and use a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, the panel we utilized was created by calling Google Finance for multiple companies. However, the panel 
that was returned was not formatted the way I expected and it bothered me for several of the lessons. At first, this 
was mentioned by the instructor in passing, and then seemed to be ignored. However, toward the end of the section, the 
course covered ways of reforming the panel to be in a different format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="inputoutput-and-visualization"&gt;Input/Output and Visualization&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#inputoutput-and-visualization" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 12 and 13 covered the portions of pandas that my users see at work. The end result of data manipulation. I 
produce visuals or excel documents and they are happy. The lessons cover how to export to CSVs and Excel (you need 
an &lt;code&gt;ExcelWriter&lt;/code&gt;). It also covers the four most common visualizations I produce at my job - line charts, bar charts, 
pie charts and histograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the scope of this course, but something I'll look into, is what else &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; can do. We did very 
little to customize our plots and I know that the library can do so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final section covers a few of the miscellaneous options pandas has. There isn't anything exciting in this section 
and these 4 lessons are short. Placing them at the end is a decent spot for them, as it reminds you to go look at the 
documentation to see what other options are available (there are a ton).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I used a coupon code to take this course for free, I feel it was worth the listed price. The course covers 19 
hours and 172 lessons. The may seem overwhelming at first, but the lessons are short, with most falling in the 4-7 
minute range. There are a couple that reach the 10+ minute point, but they still held my attention the entire lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor has the lessons structured in a way that allows you to pause and return at the start of any lesson 
without having to reexecute a long series of code. Most of the lessons are self contained, where a dataset is either 
reimported at the start of each lesson or a new one is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only Section that didn't seem to follow this pattern was the visualization module. That module kept using code 
from previous lessons. The section is less than an hour, but if you take a break you may need to rerun some of your 
code in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 "quizzes" in this course. If you've worked through the lessons with the instructor, the questions are 
very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now spent 19 hours (re)learning pandas and I feel that I've still just scratched the surface. I've learned a lot 
that I'll be taking back to my code, but throughout the course I still got the impression there is much more to pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
