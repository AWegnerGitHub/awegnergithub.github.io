&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id1"&gt;Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/"&gt;Lazy
Programmer's&lt;/a&gt; Deep
Learning courses on Udemy. A couple of those seem very interesting,
specifically the ones about Natural Language Processing. I'd love to be
able to enhance either my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;comment
flagging&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andrewwegner.com/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt;
with language processing capabilities. I also have tried, multiple
times, to come up with a way to detect duplicate questions on Stack
Overflow, but my limited knowledge of true NLP concepts has proved to be
unhelpful in that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the goal of getting to the NLP courses and completing a few other
data science and machine learning courses this year. I've picked out a
few that look interesting and useful in either personal or professional
projects. That will be my main focus in the next several months. When I
need a break from these topics, I may find another soft skills course to
look at. Or, I have a play through of Witcher 3 waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start this journey, I need to cover some prerequisites. Data Science
and Machine learning utilize several important libraries and I need to
know them or brush up my skills when using them. I took the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andrewwegner.com/data-analysis-with-pandas-review.html"&gt;Data
Analysis with
Pandas&lt;/a&gt;
last winter and found that helpful. Lazy Programmer offers one covering
the numpy stack. That's what I just finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id2"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in
Python&lt;/a&gt;
is a brief two hour course that gives a crash course in how to use
numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scipy. It touches each of these &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
briefly. The goal of the course isn't to get you intimately familiar
with the libraries. The goal is to get you to know the libraries exist
and a few of their most common tasks. In this regard, it was very
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course also served as a nice introduction to the instructor and
their teaching style. It is all hands on though, which I like. I prefer
to do the coding (and add my own comments along the way) to watching
someone present a huge chunk of code and walk through that line by line.
I've posted my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Deep-Learning-Prerequisites-The-Numpy-Stack-in-Python"&gt;IPython
Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;
on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing this course does is introduce users to the assumptions
the instructor makes about the students. Machine learning and data
science, in general, have a lot of math behind them. The instructor
assumes that students have the theorectical background for this and
teaches how to implement this math in Numpy. Note to self: Brush up on
those math skills. I haven't used some of this in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id3"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction course to the bigger &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lazyprogrammer.me/data-science-courses/"&gt;"Deep Learning"
courses&lt;/a&gt; that Lazy
Programmer offers. It does it's job well and has increased my confidence
in the instructor. My last couple courses haven't been great and I'm
happy that this quick two hour course was available. I'm looking forward
to taking some more of these courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will need to consider as I go through this course: whether
or not to either set up a Linux machine or a virtual machine. Windows
doesn'taking seem to play well with all the libraries I'll be needing.
It may make my life easier too. So far, everyone seems to be using a Mac
or Linux machine to teach these courses and offer only basic "It may
work on Windows" advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished the &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job/learn/v4/overview"&gt;"Become a Product Manager  | Learn the Skills &amp;amp; Get the job"&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy. I had picked
this up in December during one of Udemy's frequent $15 dollars. I was looking to take something non-technical that covers
more of the "soft skills" I utilize in my job. I do a lot of software "product manager" work, without the title, at my job
and was hoping to brush up on those skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is billed as a 13 hour course, with activities and interviews with product managers. The course is taught by 
Cole Mercer (a Senior product manager at &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;) and Evan Kimbrell (founder of &lt;a href="http://www.sprintkick.com/"&gt;Sprintkick&lt;/a&gt;). The course is 
packed with useful content, resources and interviews. I learned a lot and reinforced a lot of what I already knew. That 
information will be incredibly useful at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That glowing review said, I had a hard time getting through the lessons. Despite the amount of useful information, I found 
the lessons to be...boring, at best. At worst, the instructors attempted to throw jokes in that just didn't work for this format.
That type of distraction made it hard to stick with the lessons. Additionally, the quizzes that cropped up occassionally, were 
treated as a joke by the course creators. There were joke answers, there were joke explanations for answers and their were 
questions unrelated to the content but instead about the instructors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are several points in the lessons that ask students to go the message board and provide feedback, do a quick activity,
and interact with one another. I did a couple of these. I stopped doing them when I didn't receive any responses from either other
students or the instructors. A closer look at the message board shows this is very common. I have to scroll back through a couple 
"load more" clicks on the message board to find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; posts that even have a response. The interaction I was hoping for from the 
instructors just doesn't exist with this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content in this course is amazingly helpful. There are links to articles that I'll be able to use for years. The information
in the lectures is also helpful, if you can get through the bland presentation of the material. The frequent, distracting, jokes and 
lack of interaction makes this course less stellar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'd consider this a middle of the road course. The presentation is what drags down this information packed course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was originally &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291301/186281"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Exchange on February 20, 2017. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291301/186281"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Exchange and post there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post was featured across the entire Stack Exchange network for a week, too. This drove a huge amount of traffic
to the question and resulted in some valuable feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-featured-announcement.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Featured Announcement" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-featured-announcement.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;a href="http://charcoal-se.org/people.html"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; did it, so... yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-this"&gt;What is this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcoal is the &lt;a href="http://charcoal-se.org/people.html"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; bot and other &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE"&gt;nice things&lt;/a&gt;. This bot scans new 
posts across the entire network for spam posts and reports them to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Chat-Rooms"&gt;various chatrooms&lt;/a&gt; where people can act on them. 
If a post has been created or edited, anywhere on the network, we've probably seen it. The bot utilizes our knowledge 
of how spammers work and what they have previously posted to come up with common patterns and rules to detect spam in 
the new and updated posts. You've likely seen the SmokeDetector bot if you visit chatrooms such as 
&lt;a href="http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/89/tavern-on-the-meta"&gt;Tavern on the Meta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq"&gt;Charcoal HQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers"&gt;SO Close Vote Reviewers&lt;/a&gt; and others across the network. Over time, the 
bot has become very accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are leveraging the years of data and accuracy to automatically cast spam flags. With approximately 58,000 posts 
to draw from and over 46,000 true positives, we have a vast trove of data to utilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-problem-does-this-address"&gt;What problem does this address?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-problem-does-this-address" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, &lt;strong&gt;spam&lt;/strong&gt;. Stack Exchange is one of the most popular networks of websites on the Internet, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; 
of it gets spammed at some point. Our statistics show that we see about 100 spam posts per day, on average over the 
last three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent chunk of this isn't the type you'd want to see at work (or at all). The faster we can get this off the home 
page, the better for all involved. Unfortunately, it's not unheard of for spam to last several hours, even on the 
larger sites such as Graphic Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, efforts with Smokey have significantly cut the time it takes for spam to be deleted. This 
project is an extension of that, and it's now well within reach to delete spam within seconds of it being posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-doing"&gt;What are we doing?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-we-doing" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 3 years, SmokeDetector has reported potential spam across the Stack Exchange network so that users can flag 
the posts as appropriate. Users have provided feedback to inform the bot on whether the detection was correct or not 
(referred to as "feedback"). This feedback is stored in our web dashboard, &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.charcoal-se.org"&gt;metasmoke&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;). Over time, we've 
used this feedback to evaluate our patterns ("reasons") and improve our accuracy. &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/reason/106"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/reason/21"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt; 
are over 99.9% &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/reason/61"&gt;accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early last year, and after getting a baseline accuracy from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1933347/jmac"&gt;jmac&lt;/a&gt; (thank you!), we realized we could use the 
system to automatically cast spam flags. On Stack Overflow the current accuracy of users flagging spam posts is 85.7%. 
Across the rest of the network users are 95.4% accurate. We determined we can beat those numbers and eliminate spam 
from Stack Overflow and the rest of the network even faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail (if you really want it, it's available on our &lt;a href="https://charcoal-se.org/flagging"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;), we leverage the 
accuracy of each existing reason to come up with a weight indicating how certain the system is that a post is spam. If 
this value exceeds a specific threshold, the system will cast up to three spam flags on the post. We cast multiple 
flags utilizing a number of different users' accounts and the Stack Exchange API. Via metasmoke, users are given the 
opportunity to &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/ocs"&gt;enable their accounts to be used to flag spam&lt;/a&gt; (You can too, if you've made it this far). When a 
post is eligible for flagging because it exceeded the threshold set by each individual user, accounts are randomly 
selected from the pool of enabled users to cast a single flag each, up to a maximum of three per post so that we never 
unilaterally nuke something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-our-safety-checks"&gt;What are our safety checks?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-our-safety-checks" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed the entire system with accuracy and sanity checks in mind. Our design collaborations are available for 
your browsing pleasure (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bg0u4oY9W_skp79wSnyQWttUIBH8WV46JELDGJ7Bixo/edit"&gt;RFC 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1voGyl3BUA1JHJ0pR2Mf9E5-wmIDUFC1G8HcThiS7B1k/edit"&gt;RFC 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nu2U0uFbmHpb3v61WyBxjYNK34n5tFWAPYtvu13ZQCw/edit#heading=h.9nvcibv3gama"&gt;RFC 3&lt;/a&gt;). The major things that make this system safe and sane 
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We give users a choice as to how accurate they want to be with their automatic flags. Before casting any flags, we 
 check that the preferences the user has set result in a spam detection accuracy of over 99.5% over a sample of at 
 least 1000 posts. Remember, the current accuracy of humans is 85.7% on SO and network wide it is 95.4%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not unilaterally spam nuke a post, regardless of how sure we are it is spam. This means that a human &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; 
 be involved to finish off a post, even on the few sites with lower spam thresholds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ve designed the system to be tolerant of faults - if there’s a malfunction anywhere in the system, any user with 
 access to SmokeDetector can immediately halt all automatic flagging - this includes all network moderators. If this 
 happens, it needs a system administrator to step in to re-enable flags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've discussed this with a community manager and have their &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/35437121#35437121"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; on the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been casting an average of 60-70 automatic flags per day for over two months, for a total of just over 4000 
flags network wide. These flags were cast by 22 different users. In that time, we've had &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/logs?filter=fps"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; false positives. 
We would like to be able to automatically cancel these particular cases. This isn't possible though, so we've created 
a feature request to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/288120/allow-retracting-flags-from-the-api"&gt;retract flags via the API&lt;/a&gt;. In the mean time, the flags are either manually retracted by the 
user or declined by a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-weights-and-accuracies.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Weights and Accuracy" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-weights-and-accuracies.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above graph plots the weight of the reasons against its overall volume of reports and accuracy. As minimum weight 
increases, accuracy (yellow line and rightmost Y-axis) and total reports (blue line) on the left-hand scale increase. 
The green line represents the number of true positives, which are verified by SmokeDetector user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-autoflags-per-day.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Automatic Flags per day" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-autoflags-per-day.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows the number of posts we've automatically flagged per day over the last month. The jump on February 15th, is 
due to increasing the number of automatic flags from 1 per post to 3 per post. You can see a live version of this graph 
on &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging"&gt;metasmoke's autoflagging page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-spam-hours.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spam Hours" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-spam-hours.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spam arrives on Stack Exchange in waves. It is easy to see the time of day that many spam reports come in. The hours, 
above, are UTC time. The busiest spam times of day are the 8 hour block between 4am and Noon. We have affectionately 
named this "spam hour" in the chat room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-average-time-to-delete.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Average Time to Deletion" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-average-time-to-delete.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to delete spam quickly and accurately. The graph shows the time it takes for a reported spam post to be 
removed from the network. This section has three trend lines that show these averages. The first, red section is when 
we were simply reporting the posts to chatrooms and all flags had to come from users. You can see we are pretty constant 
in the time it takes to remove spam during this period. It took, on average, just over five minutes to get a post 
removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green trend line is when we were issuing a single automatic flag. At implementation, we eliminated a full minute 
from time to deletion and after a month we'd eliminated two full minutes compared to no automatic flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last section, the orange, is when we implemented three automatic flags to most sites. This was rolled out last 
week, but it's already had a dramatic improvement on the time to deletion. We are seeing between 1 and 2 minutes to 
time to deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, spam arrives in waves. The dashed and dotted lines on the graph show the average deletion time 
during these two different time periods. The dashed lines show deletion time during 4am and Noon UTC, the dotted lines 
show the rest of the 24 hour period. An interesting thing this graph shows is that time to deletion during spam hour 
was higher when we didn't cast any automatic flags. It was removed faster outside of spam hour. That reversed when we 
started issuing a single auto-flag. The spam hour time to deletion is slightly lower than the average. Comparing the 
two time periods though, time to deletion during non-spam hour at the end of the non-flagging time period and the end 
of the single flag period are roughly the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll update these in a few weeks too, to better show the trend we are seeing with three automatic flags.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discussion"&gt;Discussion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident in SmokeDetector and the three years of history it has. We've had many talented developers assist us 
over the years and many more users have provided feedback to improve our detection rules. Let us know what you want us 
to elaborate on, features you're wondering about or would like to see added, or things we might have missed in the 
process or the tooling. Take a look at the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/288120/allow-retracting-flags-from-the-api"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; we'd really like Stack Exchange to consider so that we can 
further improve this system (and some of the other community built systems). We'll have &lt;a href="http://charcoal-se.org/people.html"&gt;Charcoal members&lt;/a&gt; hanging 
around and answering your questions. Alternatively, feel free to drop into &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq"&gt;Charcoal HQ&lt;/a&gt; and have a chat. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="machine learning"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's "From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase" course</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/loony-corn-machine-learning-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-28T20:10:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2016-12-28:/loony-corn-machine-learning-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of "From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase" on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to squeeze one more course in before 2016 ended. This time I chose 
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/from-0-1-machine-learning/learn/v4/overview"&gt;"From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase"&lt;/a&gt; by the LoonyCorn team on Udemy. This course was
a 20 hour overview of machine learning techniques. I've been interested in taking some more formal training on various
machine learning algorithms and this course sounded like it would be useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very disappointed in this course. The lessons had large portions of time that overlapped one another, the 
background music was distracting, the instructor's speaking volume isn't consistent, the "coding" portions weren't
done in a way that allowed me to follow along, code was presented with bugs and the instructor glossed over
these with a simple "we'll fix those later". The theories were presented fairly well but really should have been
condensed into a handful of lessons instead of spread out so broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few lessons to realize it, but the course notes - effectively power point slides that are hand written 
during the lecture - and the instructor's voice were recorded at different times. Multiple times through the lessons,
the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same portion is used repeatedly. Lecture notes are "rewritten" or explained again. This repetition is used
ineffectively, as the instructor's voice isn't consistent within a single lecture. The repeated parts are either much
louder or much softer than the surrounding lecture material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest disappointment, though, was with the coding exercises. I was hoping for some hands on activities. Instead,
the instructor spoke while the code - with all comments - was coded "live". The code was done quickly and offered no time
for me to both code and listen to the explanation. Like the lecture notes, the code and the vocal explanation was
recorded at different times. This means when a bug is encountered in the code, it is simply glossed over in the
explanation as an area they will return to later to fix. This was incredibly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course wasn't worth my time. The theory portions were &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; good enough that I stuck with it hoping to pick out
something useful, but it never seemed to materialize. I did complete the course and don't feel I've learned anything
that I can apply elsewhere. In the new year, I'll be looking for another machine learning course that, hopefully, is
much better than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a few years since I finished my formal education. I've been getting the itch to take a few more structured 
training courses, but don't have the desire to commit to another full university degree. Fortunately, there are a lot 
of places online that now offer training and college courses (both free and paid). I'll be picking out a few and going 
through them as my free time permits. I'll be sharing my thoughts on the courses in a series of posts with a review of 
the course and, if available, a link to show what I produced during the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-analysis-with-pandas"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#data-analysis-with-pandas" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;/a&gt; by Boris Paskhaver on Udemy. I use pandas both at work and in 
personal projects and constantly find new things the library can do. This course is billed as a 19 hour course spanning 
173 lectures. The curriculum looked like it covered both basics and topics I was less familiar with. It also helped 
that the instructor was offering a coupon code on reddit to take the course for free. I decided to take the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler&lt;/em&gt;: Even if this wasn't free, this class was worth the price. It covered a large part of pandas and did so in a 
way that didn't make me tune out the instructor, even after 19 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course starts a bit slow with your basic "How to install" tutorials. The entire course is done in a series of 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Data-Analysis-with-Pandas"&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; and, obviously, requires that you have Python (the instructor uses 3.5), pandas and a few 
other modules installed before we get to the good stuff. The instructor uses OS X during all lectures, but that has 
no effect on how things are communicated to the student. Everything is done in the Jupyter Notebooks or at a &lt;a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"&gt;conda&lt;/a&gt; 
prompt. This works the same across all major operating systems. The only reason I felt this was slow was because I 
already had all of the requirements installed due to using the library before. I understand the need for this lesson, 
though, and can't hold it against the instructor for needing to include this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I liked about the introduction was that the instructor provided a series of CSV files we'd use 
throughout the rest of the lessons. These CSVs were varied in size and composition. I thought this was a great way to 
keep everyone on the same page. I've seen a lot of tutorials on pandas around the internet and most of them depend on 
generating random data. By providing everyone with a set of CSVs it is much easier to focus on specific aspects of the 
data and how certain functions work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="series-and-dataframes"&gt;Series and DataFrames&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#series-and-dataframes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course really begins in Section 2 which is on the pandas &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html"&gt;Series&lt;/a&gt; object. It covers what a series is, various 
methods of creating one, and then goes over the various methods and attributes you can use on a series object. The 
module covers 21 lessons and lays the foundation for the entire pandas library. Section 3, 4, and 5 cover 
&lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html"&gt;DataFrames&lt;/a&gt;. These sections cover 41 lessons. DataFrames are the heart of the pandas library. This is the object 
you'll use most of the time, which explains the number of lessons that focus on DataFrames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lessons cover everything from selecting a series (column) in a data frame, adding a new column, dropping null 
values and sorting values. More advanced topics include various ways of filtering a dataframe to only the data you are 
interested in, applying a function to all values and working with either index labels or index positions. These modules 
are the heart of the entire course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="text-data-and-datetime-data"&gt;Text data and DateTime data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#text-data-and-datetime-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 6 and 10 deal with text data and datetime data. One complaint I had about these two sections was that they 
were separated so much. Both types of data need to be operated on the same way in pandas. Namely, you have to add 
either &lt;code&gt;.str&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.dt&lt;/code&gt; when calling a string or datetime function. I also think that datetimes are important enough 
and used frequently enough that getting a lesson in on how to properly use them early would make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That complaint aside, both sections cover their content well. There isn't anything ground breaking here, especially 
if you've done any sort of work with either strings or dates in Python. The functions introduced all work as you'd 
expect based on that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DateTime section also provides information on how to work with date offsets and time deltas. Adding and 
subtracting days/weeks/months is always important and the lessons cover how to do so pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="advanced-features"&gt;Advanced Features&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-features" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 7, 8 and 9 cover aspects of pandas that many will use as well. These cover ways to join and group multiple data 
sets into a single data frame and the benefits of each method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MultiIndexes are not something I've used a lot, but after these 14 lessons I have already thought of ways I can 
improve my code at work to utilize these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="panels"&gt;Panels&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#panels" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 11 covers a topic that was brand new to me: Panels. I have never used them or heard of them. A series is a 1D 
dataset, a dataframe is a 2D dataset and a panel is a 3D dataset. It is a group of dataframes. The instructor explained 
this concept very clearly and worked through multiple examples of how to build and use a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, the panel we utilized was created by calling Google Finance for multiple companies. However, the panel 
that was returned was not formatted the way I expected and it bothered me for several of the lessons. At first, this 
was mentioned by the instructor in passing, and then seemed to be ignored. However, toward the end of the section, the 
course covered ways of reforming the panel to be in a different format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="inputoutput-and-visualization"&gt;Input/Output and Visualization&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#inputoutput-and-visualization" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 12 and 13 covered the portions of pandas that my users see at work. The end result of data manipulation. I 
produce visuals or excel documents and they are happy. The lessons cover how to export to CSVs and Excel (you need 
an &lt;code&gt;ExcelWriter&lt;/code&gt;). It also covers the four most common visualizations I produce at my job - line charts, bar charts, 
pie charts and histograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the scope of this course, but something I'll look into, is what else &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; can do. We did very 
little to customize our plots and I know that the library can do so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="options"&gt;Options&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section covers a few of the miscellaneous options pandas has. There isn't anything exciting in this section 
and these 4 lessons are short. Placing them at the end is a decent spot for them, as it reminds you to go look at the 
documentation to see what other options are available (there are a ton).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I used a coupon code to take this course for free, I feel it was worth the listed price. The course covers 19 
hours and 172 lessons. The may seem overwhelming at first, but the lessons are short, with most falling in the 4-7 
minute range. There are a couple that reach the 10+ minute point, but they still held my attention the entire lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor has the lessons structured in a way that allows you to pause and return at the start of any lesson 
without having to reexecute a long series of code. Most of the lessons are self contained, where a dataset is either 
reimported at the start of each lesson or a new one is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only Section that didn't seem to follow this pattern was the visualization module. That module kept using code 
from previous lessons. The section is less than an hour, but if you take a break you may need to rerun some of your 
code in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 "quizzes" in this course. If you've worked through the lessons with the instructor, the questions are 
very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now spent 19 hours (re)learning pandas and I feel that I've still just scratched the surface. I've learned a lot 
that I'll be taking back to my code, but throughout the course I still got the impression there is much more to pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="notebooks"&gt;Notebooks&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#notebooks" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notebooks that I created during this course are all available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Data-Analysis-with-Pandas"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html"&gt;I ran for moderator&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;) on Stack Overflow and didn't make it through the primaries. I came 
close on that second run. Now, a year later, and a year more experienced, I'm going to try again. This post will 
document my progress through the election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert&lt;/em&gt;: I didn't win. The rest of this post details my thoughts as the election occured though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election this year took a slightly different route than last time. In previous years, the election was announced
at the same time as the call for nominations began. Users had a week to nominate themselves, then we answered a series
of community provided questions during the primaries, then the final election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the election was announced a week in advance of nominations. During the week, a call was put out for 
&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/337191/189134"&gt;Community questions&lt;/a&gt;. When a nomination was posted, the answers would be posted as well. This change was made due
to how much the community needed to read during the primaries. The primaries were only a few days long and the Q&amp;amp;As 
were usually ten questions for each user. When a primary has 20-30 nominees, that is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of reading that was 
expected in a short period of time. By bringing this phase forward, now the community has the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; election cycle
to read and interact with the nominees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I provided &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337238/189134"&gt;one question&lt;/a&gt; that was used in the final selection of questions. I mentioned &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; that I 
thought it was a great question, so I suggested it again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Meta posts that you're particularly proud of, or that you feel best demonstrate your moderation style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-nomination"&gt;My nomination&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-nomination" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/8?tab=nomination#post-40473869"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; isn't all the different than the last two times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, I'm &lt;strong&gt;Andy&lt;/strong&gt; and I'd like to be a moderator for you and Stack Overflow. I've answered the questions posted by the community &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337574/189134"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-should-you-vote-for-me"&gt;Why should you vote for me?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-should-you-vote-for-me" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt; for over two years. I know the moderator tools and have worked with many of the current moderators. This interaction will continue as a new moderator here. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a lot of helpful flags. A decent percentage of these are on &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;, but not all. I'd like to help keep the site clean without adding to the current moderators' work load. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm active in the review queues (currently holding 5th in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/stats"&gt;Low Quality Post reviewers&lt;/a&gt; of all time), provide edits to posts, answers and enjoy the moderation aspect of Stack Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/"&gt;history on Meta.SO&lt;/a&gt; that shows I'm involved in the meta aspect of the site as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the moderation aspect on Stack Overflow (and Stack Exchange in general). I have a history of good community moderation, am here all the time and believe I can help the current team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first full day, I'm gotten positive responses to this post. My two favorite, so far, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy's work around comment flags has been very impressive. I'm definitely curious to see what his thoughts on the mod 
queue are and if we could incorporate some of his work permanently on the site. Better identification of flags is 
something that would be very nice to have permanently.  - &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/426671/bluefeet"&gt;bluefeet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stack Overflow Community Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always some nominees for this position who are very active, some who have good judgment and cool heads, and 
some who innovate with their approach to community moderation. Andy is the rare candidate who very clearly checks all 
three boxes. As a user on SO for 3.5 years, a moderator pro tempore on Engineering SE for 1.7 years and an early 
participant in the Community Building SE beta, I strongly support this nomination. - &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2359271/air"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://engineering.stackexchange.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderator on Engineering.SE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My candidate score this time is an impressive 39/40. This is up six from a year ago, and up ten from my first run. The 
one missing point is due to missing the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4369/refiner"&gt;Refiner&lt;/a&gt; badge. I believe the reason for this is because of my workflow. I,
generally, don't edit and answer questions at the same time. If I'm answering, I'm not in "edit" mode. If I'm editting, 
I'm usually in "moderation" mode. It's something I'll work on. I'm 38 out of 50 questions there, so I'll get it soon 
enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/november_2016_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="candidate-questions"&gt;Candidate questions&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#candidate-questions" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the questions were that surprising. With the added benefit of a week to prepare answers prior to nominating,
I am very pleased with my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337574/189134"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;. Two answers have generated a bit of discussion though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10k+ user regularly has their comments flagged as "rude or offensive" or "not constructive", to the tune of 
4-5 flags a day. No comment by itself is particularly offensive, but their general tone causes them to be flagged 
by multiple users. You've contacted them privately about this, but they believe that they aren't doing anything wrong 
and that people are being too sensitive. The flags keep coming in on their comments. What, if anything, do you do 
next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has an exemption from the Be Nice policy. I think the first step is to understand why nothing has already been 
done about the user. 4-5 a day seems like the user has moved beyond the "nuisance" stage. I think a temporary ban is 
appropriate, with another explanation as to what is expected when interacting with others. While some users are more 
sensitive than others, a stream of this many flags across an extended period of time doesn't lead me to believe the 
problem is with the community users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point raised in the comments was that I was rushing into banning the user without commuicating first. I disagree
with that, and explained that they've already been contacted privately and ignored those warnings. A ban is the next 
step in getting the user's attention. I was told this would be "humiliating" for a high rep user. Again, I disagree
and believe it's not humiliating, but &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/337571/2016-stack-overflow-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire/337574#comment411104_337574"&gt;educating&lt;/a&gt; the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question that generated some discussion was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You impose a temporary ban (say 1 week) on a user for what you judged as reasonable and valid reasons (the user 
gets notified by email of your action and the reason). The user replies to your email acknowledging the transgression,
says they won't do it again and asks for the ban to be lifted. The user sounds genuine. Do you remove the ban? Do you 
even reply at all? Explain your reasoning. The context of this question applies to longer bans too. If it helps get 
the juices flowing, consider the situation of a second offence for the same behaviour, which has a default ban 
period of 1 month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two answers for this question, based on the user's history. If this is a first offense, up to this point the 
user hasn't been pushing limits and attempting to disrupt others, and the ban isn't related to voting fraud, then I'd 
be willing to remove the ban. Sometimes a ban is put in place to get the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/288229/why-was-balusc-temporarily-suspended-from-so"&gt;user's attention&lt;/a&gt;. Once the situation 
has been resolved, the ban is no longer appropriate and should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the user has a history of crossing the line and looking for a reaction, or if the ban is 
related to vote fraud, I'd simply not reply and the user will return in a week. Stack Overflow has enough "voting 
irregularity" bans that I imagine the responses to such bans are all similar (and invalid). I see no reason to 
change that policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push back I recieved on this was that I was letting a user off the hook by unbanning them. I argued that unbanning
has been done in the past. Sometimes the ban is needed simply to get the user's attention and start the conversation
and explain that why they are doing is wrong. If the user abuses the trust at that point and repeats the behavior, then
the longer ban is completely justified. A bit of compassion isn't a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 12 nominees, so a primary will occur. Once again, the primary phase will reduce the number of candidates in
the final phase to 10. With so few being eliminated this time around, it feels a little unneeded. The primary will last 
for a few days and during that time users can vote candidates up or down depending whether they believe the nominee
should be a moderator. I'll return in a few days...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="primary-results"&gt;Primary Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Primary phase has ended and the final election has begun. I ended the primary in 5th place, securing a position 
in the final election. I have a sizable margin between my position and sixth place as well. One other stat that I'm
rather proud of: I received the fewest number of down votes of any candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Primary Results" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/2016-Fall-SO-Primary-Results.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the election! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election-phase"&gt;Election Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election lasts for several days and covers a weekend. We'll see how it turns out in a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="election-results"&gt;Election Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the election has concluded. I didn't secure on of the three positions for moderator. I finished in &lt;a href="http://www.opavote.com/results/6488198410665984/0"&gt;5th place&lt;/a&gt;,
with my elimination propelling second and third place to a victory. I was eliminated in the 10th round of the Meek STV
process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to the new moderators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="post-election-thoughts"&gt;Post Election thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#post-election-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This election started differently than the previous two I've run in. This election was announced a week in advance
and solicited community input for questions for the candidates. I think this was a good change. The element of 
surprise in the previous two made it much more stressful. Additionally, by having the questions available at the start
of the election - instead of at the start of the primary phase - I was able to better answer the questions. Previously,
the questions would be available at the start of the primary phase. With the amount of reading needed to get through
one candidate's answers, let alone all of them, I imagine that many people didn't read all of the responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other nice thing about this lead time, is that I had time to get my answers read for when I posted my nomination. 
By posting the questions and answers at the same time, I was able to have my responses available the entire time. 
Score-wise, on the questionnaire, I did much better than my opponents. I think a big reason for this is that I have my
responses posted as soon as my nomination was posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question this time, though, seemed to split the candidates. I mentioned it previously, but it was regarding 
potentially removing a temporary ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You impose a temporary ban (say 1 week) on a user for what you judged as reasonable and valid reasons (the user 
gets notified by email of your action and the reason). The user replies to your email acknowledging the transgression,
says they won't do it again and asks for the ban to be lifted. The user sounds genuine. Do you remove the ban? Do you 
even reply at all? Explain your reasoning. The context of this question applies to longer bans too. If it helps get 
the juices flowing, consider the situation of a second offence for the same behaviour, which has a default ban 
period of 1 month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of two candidates that explicitly stated we'd consider removing the ban. A third user didn't state it 
explicitly, but did say they'd consider it. I was surprised by the harsh tone the others took, especially since there
is a lot of previous discussions on Meta where the outcome is the moderators or community managers removing the ban. I 
was happy to see that the other candidate who said they'd consider removing the ban get elected though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still believe that removing the ban is a valid option. Especially because their &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; ban would be much longer if 
they broke my trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see when the next election on Stack Overflow is, but with three new moderators and no resignations, I suspect
it'll be a while. I'll consider running again then. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>My experiences releasing a package to PyPI</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/my-experiences-releasing-a-package-to-pypi.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-15T12:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-03-15T12:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2016-03-15:/my-experiences-releasing-a-package-to-pypi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I released StackAPI to PyPI. This post talks about my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of my &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;other projects&lt;/a&gt;, I've needed to make extensive use of the Stack Exchange API. I built a small library - StackAPI - to assist in this task and released it on Python's &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/StackAPI"&gt;PyPI repository&lt;/a&gt;. This post is going to cover some of the technical decisions and issues I ran into while going through this process. This was my first project being released to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals when releasing this were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up my own code so that it is usable by others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the documentation and host the documentation on &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically release it to PyPI, if it passes basic tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those goals sound simple. In the future, they probably will be, but for this first release it wasn't as simple as I was hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="project-layout"&gt;Project Layout&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#project-layout" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this project, I'd written modules and libraries that were used by myself (for personal projects) or as part of a larger application (for work). In both cases, though, I had a directory structure that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/project_root
    /mymodule
        __init__.py
        mymodule.py
    __init__.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was close to the end goal, but lacked some files in the &lt;code&gt;project_root&lt;/code&gt; that were needed for a proper install via &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;. The important file that was missing was &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;. I needed this file to ensure that everything would install with a simple &lt;code&gt;pip install stackapi&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="setuppy"&gt;setup.py&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setuppy" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/setup.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is pretty basic and available on GitHub. There are a couple important things though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;: This is needed, but I didn't want to have to constantly remember to update this when pushing a version to PyPI. This was one of my first criteria when starting the project. I wanted to automate as much as I could, and versioning was at the top of that list. It's small, but easy to forget and keep syncronized across all the files in the project. I decided to utilize &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion"&gt;bumpversion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fabfile.org/"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; to manage this specific field (both here and elsewhere in the project).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_requires&lt;/code&gt;: StackAPI is built in the fantasitc &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; library. To ensure this was installed when StackAPI was install, it was needed in this field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tests_require&lt;/code&gt;: The testsuite I build utilizes the &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; library. I don't want that to be installed if the developer isn't running the tests, so it is added to this field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_suite&lt;/code&gt;: I wanted developers to be able to run &lt;code&gt;python setup.py test&lt;/code&gt; to execute the test suite. To do so, I had to point to the where the tests were being executed from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; seemed to be fairly standard when compared to other Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bumpversion-and-fabric"&gt;Bumpversion and Fabric&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#bumpversion-and-fabric" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I wanted to automate any versioning that was required. To do so, I used the &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion"&gt;bumpversion&lt;/a&gt; library and wrote a small &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/fabfile.py"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; script to handle it automatically. &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; uses a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/setup.cfg"&gt;config file&lt;/a&gt;, to determine what it is going to do. I configured it to automatically create a commit and a new git tag for each version. I then pointed to a couple files where the current version is listed. When &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it will change the version in each of those files to the new version. It will then create a single commit to the git repository with a commit message similar to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bump version: 0.1.6 → 0.1.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is nice and clean. It tags the commit for me, which is useful later, when I want to push the change to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make running &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; a bit easier, I utilized a Fabric routine I found &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jbarratt/85c91d7b904462702892"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; and adjusted it for my purposes. When I run &lt;code&gt;fab release&lt;/code&gt;, all of the &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; 'stuff' occurs. Then I just have to push the commit (and new tag) to GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="final-project-layout"&gt;Final Project Layout&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-project-layout" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final project layout I settled on was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/stackapi
    /docs
        ...
    /stackapi
        __init__.py
        stackapi.py
    /tests
    .gitignore
    .travis.yml
    fabfile.py
    setup.cfg
    setup.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="read-the-docs"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#read-the-docs" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="configure-the-project"&gt;Configure the project&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#configure-the-project" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final project layout, you can see there is a &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory. One of my goals was to make this library usable and understandable by other developers. A good part of that means having decent documentation. I spent way more time than I expected cleaning the documentation in the code and creating documentation with examples. Most of that time was spent learning the sphinx documentation style and ReStructuredText, which Read the Docs utilizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in this process was installing and setting up the initial configuration for the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I created the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory and switched to it and ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sphinx-quickstart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts a short, interactive, wizard. Fill out the questions. At the end of this, it creates a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/docs/conf.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory. The rest of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/tree/master/docs"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is ReStructuredText files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how the documentation looks, from the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;make html
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a &lt;code&gt;_build&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you open &lt;code&gt;_build/html/index.html&lt;/code&gt;, the documentation can be browsed locally. I do not commit this directory to git, though. It is ignored in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;, as a user can regenerate it at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="configure-read-the-docs"&gt;Configure Read the Docs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#configure-read-the-docs" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was satisfied with how the documentation looked, I had to configure Read the Docs to read my GitHub repository. To repeat those steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up (or log in) at &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt; (part of this will be associating the account to a GitHub account)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit your &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and click "Import a project"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the form, but in my case the defaults were all appropriate. Do note that URLs are case sensitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "Create". This is the first version of your documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep the code updating as you update GitHub, log into GitHub and go to the repository's "Settings" page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "Webhooks &amp;amp; Services"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "Add Service"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "ReadTheDocs" and add the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, each time you push a change to the repository, a new set of documents will be built. I then added the Read the Docs badge to my &lt;code&gt;README.rst&lt;/code&gt; for a simple link to the detailed documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; https://readthedocs.org/projects/stackapi/badge/?version=latest
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;:target:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;http://stackapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;:alt:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Documentation Status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="force-rebuild-of-docs"&gt;Force rebuild of docs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#force-rebuild-of-docs" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the very end of this project, Read the Docs had a minor hiccup and failed on building my documentation. I didn't want to force a build by making a fake commit. Instead, Read the Docs provides the information needed to force a rebuild. It requires a very simple &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; to the Post Commit Hook they provide. In my case, this was as simple as running this command (provided from the Dashboard):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;curl -X POST https://readthedocs.org/build/stackapi
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pypi"&gt;PyPI&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pypi" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of the journey, it was time to see what exactly PyPI required. The first step was setting up an account on both the Test and Production instances of PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PiPY Test: http://testpypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyPI Live: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having one on both was important while testing. It meant that I didn't have to send broken versions to the live PyPI server, and I could adjust ReStructuredText formatting issues without requiring another release to PyPI. Each time a version is pushed to PyPI it &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have a new version number. By using the test instance, I could use as many of these fake versions as needed to fix things. Hooray for test environments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we perform this step automatically, we need to test that the PyPI accounts work. By following portions of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/.travis.yml"&gt;"First Time with PyPI"&lt;/a&gt; tutorial, I focused by steps down to these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.pypirc&lt;/code&gt; file in your home directory - not your project directory. This won't be required once Travis CI is set up and configured, so having the passwords in this, temporarily, wasn't an issue because I eventually deleted the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[distutils]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;index-servers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;  pypi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;  pypitest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[pypi]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_username&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_password&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[pypitest]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://testpypi.python.org/pypi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_username&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_password&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the package on PyPI Test: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypitest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the package on PyPI Live: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the project to Test: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypitest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the project to Live, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you're ready for your first release. Remember, once a version is released to PyPI, it can't be used again (or overwritten): &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of the above passed to your satisfaction, you can remove the &lt;code&gt;.pypirc&lt;/code&gt; file and move on to configuring Travis CI.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="travis"&gt;Travis&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#travis" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step in this process will be using Travis CI to perform some basic tests and, if this was a new release, push the changes to PyPI. The Travis config file is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/.travis.yml"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to support 'modern' Python with this library. I've configured Travis to test against multiple versions of Python, ranging from 2.7 to 3.5. StackAPI is installed using &lt;code&gt;python setup.py -q install&lt;/code&gt;. Then the test suite is run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important bits are in the &lt;code&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a new git tag pushed to GitHub, and the tests pass, Travis CI will push the code to PyPI. Since &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; makes a new git tag with each new version, this works perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does require that my password be included in the yml file. To keep this secure, I utilized the &lt;a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-01-14-new-client/"&gt;Travis Command Line Client&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;gem install travis&lt;/code&gt;). In my local directory, I then ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;travis encrypt --add deploy.password
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This added the password to the YML file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I've released something to PyPI. It took a lot more set up than I expected it would take. However, now that I've gone through the process, gotten used to the ReStructuredText format that Sphinx and Read the Docs require, and set up PyPI for one project, I think it'll be fairly simple to do in the future. Most of the work is getting the other services to talk with GitHub and practicing good developer habits (documentation...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="all-stackapi-links"&gt;All StackAPI Links&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#all-stackapi-links" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these links are to the various places that StackAPI lives on the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt;: http://stackapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; Vipers early this year, I've been itching to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; web related. Web technologies aren't my best technical skill, but I like trying out new things and learning something in the process. I use Python at work. I like Python a lot. With Christmas and New Years coming up, I want to have a project during my down time. My goal is to get a &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; application built and then deployed to &lt;a href="https://www.openshift.com/"&gt;OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;. Part of this deployment is to utilize &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;TravisCI&lt;/a&gt;. I'm planning on using &lt;a href="http://pytest.org/latest/"&gt;pytest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; for my test suite. Finally, I want to use my own (sub)domain, instead of the provided &lt;code&gt;rhcloud&lt;/code&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these three technologies, I've used only Flask before. The &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;comment flagging bot&lt;/a&gt; I built has a dashboard built in Flask. I've never used OpenShift or TravisCI. I selected OpenShift because it has a couple &lt;a href="http://www.paasify.it/compare/heroku-vs-openshift%20online"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; I want that Heroku doesn't. The biggest one, according to the previous link, was that OpenShift has support for MySQL and Heroku doesn't (surprisingly). I want to use TravisCI and automated testing, because one of my goals for next year at work is to introduce automated tested to our development. (I work with Engineers, not coders...that's my excuse and it's a bad excuse, so I'm going to try and fix it.) To get ready for that goal, I want to test out a system that does continuous integration/automated testing. Both OpenShift and Travis CI provide me with free services. Hypothesis and py.test provide me with a way to generate comprehensive test conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="openshift-set-up"&gt;OpenShift set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#openshift-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing up for OpenShift was easy. Fill out the form, provide an email address - though they don't like email addresses with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; signs, which is disappointing - and then click the link they email back to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;code&gt;rhc&lt;/code&gt; OpenShift client tools are needed. This is a Ruby package. I have no experience with Ruby, so I needed to install Ruby as well. I ran into a problem almost immediately. The &lt;a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for installing these tools says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenShift rhc can be run on any operating system with Ruby 1.8.7 or higher assuming you have the requisite user permissions to install programs. Instructions for specific operating systems are provided below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on that, I figured I'd install the latest version of &lt;a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I tested this, that was 2.2.3. Unfortunately, when I ran the command to install the &lt;code&gt;rhc&lt;/code&gt; tools, I received an error. After a bit of Googling, I found that it doesn't like 2.2x. So, I installed 2.1.7 instead. Next, I ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;gem install rhc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This installs several gems and took a few minutes to complete. Next,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rhc setup
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started the OpenShift setup wizard. It consisted of filling out the few prompts and letting it generate an SSH key and then connecting to my account. Remember the Namespace you select. Again, this took a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="flask-setup"&gt;Flask setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#flask-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to set up my first "Gear". This would be the Flask application. I'll work on the database next. First, I just want Python and Flask to function properly. Fortunately, this is very easy, as OpenShift has a Flask template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rhc app create testapp python-2.7 --from-code=https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/flask-base.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am utilizing Python 2.7, because that is the recommendation from the Flask team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;testapp&lt;/code&gt; can be any alphanumeric string. This is the name that will appear in the Web Console. A specific note, &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is not alphanumeric. I'm getting the feeling that OpenShift doesn't like "special" characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--from-code&lt;/code&gt; parameter will download that repository and use it as the base of your application. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Flask can be run locally using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;python app.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application can be pushed back to OpenShift at this point and there should be a functional page on your OpenShift domain. In your command line, from the directory of your project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git add --all
git commit -m "Adding Flask application"
git push
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will take a moment. At the end, you should see these lines in your command prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Receive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Activation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Deployment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all three are a success, then you should be able to visit your URL. Your URL is a combination of your selected Namespace and the application name you created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;http://&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;testapp&amp;gt;.rhcloud.com/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should show a "Welcome to Flask on OpenShift" page. If you append &lt;code&gt;/test&lt;/code&gt; to your URL, you'll get a message that says "It's Alive!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't, you can check your error logs by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rhc tail -a &amp;lt;testapp&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mysql-setup"&gt;MySQL setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mysql-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I set up my application to utilize MySQL. It's the database I have the most experience with, so I decided to keep that aspect of this project simple for myself. The first step was to add a MySQL 5.5 cartridge to my test gear (OpenShift terminology). I did this in the OpenShift web console. The UI provided me with the option to install various databases and one of those was MySQL. Clicking the link caused a few second delay as it was set up, and then I was presented with login credentials to my database. Step one...done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is installing the correct Python modules to utilize MySQL. I selected &lt;a href="http://www.pymysql.org/"&gt;PyMySQL&lt;/a&gt; (again, experience) and &lt;a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt;. I added these to both &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;. The idea behind doing it in both places is to make life easy for myself in the future. Additionally, the quick tutorials I've looked at for TravisCI encourage the usage of &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;, while it seems OpenShift uses the &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;. I'll fix that eventually, but getting it set up initially, this will be fastest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add these to &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sqlalchemy==1.0.9
pymysql==0.6.7
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this to the &lt;code&gt;install_requires&lt;/code&gt; list in &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'sqlalchemy==1.0.9','pymysql==0.6.7','Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1'
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about OpenShift is that the credentials to the database are placed in &lt;a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-environment-variables.html#database-variables"&gt;environment variables&lt;/a&gt;, so I don't need to embed the passwords, connections strings, or anything potentially sensitive in my code. For MySQL these are available as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Variable Name               |   Purpose
------------------------------------------------
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST     |   The host name or IP address used to connect to the database.
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT     |   The port the database server is listening on.
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME |   The database administrative user name.
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD |   The database administrative user’s password.
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_SOCKET   |   An AF socket for connecting to the database (for non-scaled apps only).
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL      |   Database connection URL.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="utilizing-the-database"&gt;Utilizing the database&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#utilizing-the-database" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up SQLAlchemy and MySQL is fairly easy. I tested this with a simple table and ensured that it appeared in the database as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;__tablename__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'users'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'user_id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;primary_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few adjustments were made to the import statements of the Flask application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask_sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple variables were created and loaded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;app.config.from_pyfile('flaskapp.cfg')
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;flaskapp.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file was modified to include these two lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL'] + os.environ['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME]
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="remote-mysql-access"&gt;Remote MySQL Access&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#remote-mysql-access" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to use &lt;a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/"&gt;MySQL Workbench&lt;/a&gt; while building and testing to watch what's happening in the database. To use that with OpenShift, I had to jump through a few small hoops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the connection a name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In "Connection Method", select "Standard TCP/IP over SSH"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SSH Hostname is the full name of your OpenShift gear where MySQL is installed. It should look like &lt;code&gt;namespace-appname.rhcloud.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SSH Username is the gear's Unique Identifier. This can be found by looking at the &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. It can also be found in the web console, but looking at the "remote access" section. It shows a connection string. You need the username portion. This is the part that appears before the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;ssh longuniquestring@namespace-appname.rhcloud.com&lt;/code&gt; command. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the SSH key file. On Windows this is in &lt;code&gt;\Users\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\.ssh\id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set MySQL Hostname equal to the value in &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Username equal to the value in &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt; (this was also provided to you when you installed MySQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Password equal to the value in &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; (again, this was provided to you when MySQL was installed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="travisci-setup"&gt;TravisCI setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#travisci-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to play with automated testing. The idea behind this is to get a jump start on a goal for next year at work and to learn something new. I'd like to utilize Travis CI to perform the tests and if they pass, deploy to OpenShift. If the tests fail, I don't want to push a broken build to OpenShift. That's the goal...we'll see how it turns out. But, the first step is getting Travis CI and OpenShift talking to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis CI integrates with GitHub, so what I'm going to do in reality is push to GitHub and let Travis CI pick up the changes. From there, it will perform it's tests. If the tests pass, it will push the commit to OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On GitHub, create a new repository for your source. This is where you will be pushing your code for Travis CI to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your OpenShift directory (which is already a git repository):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote rename origin openshift
git remote add origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;USER&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;repositoryname&amp;gt;.git
git push -u origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resets the origin to point to your new GitHub repository and sets up a new remote. Then it pushes the changes to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log into your &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile"&gt;Travis CI profile page&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you are logged into GitHub first, as this will create the profile automatically. Press the "Sync now" button at the top of the page to pull a list of all of your repositories. Once that is done, find the repository you just set up, and enable integration with that repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you need to set up Travis CI and the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;gem install travis
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will install a Ruby script that assists in this process. If you get an error when running this, you need to create an empty &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file first and then run the command again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;travis setup openshift
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out the prompts. Defaults should be fine in most cases, but do pay attention to "OpenShift application name". If your GitHub repository is named differently than your OpenShift application name, the default for this prompt will be incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last note, for a quick test you can change the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; section to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forces the tests to pass. Once you've written tests, you can do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;script:
    - py.test
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will run your test scripts, utilizing &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy these changes to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git add .travis.yml
git commit -m "Deploying Travis"
git push origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will commit and push the changes to GitHub. A few seconds later, if you are watching Travis CI, you'll see it notices the new commit and starts running tests. If you tests complete with a status code of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (successful), it will deploy the changes to OpenShift. If the tests fail (any other status code), it will not deploy to OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pytest-setup"&gt;py.test setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pytest-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up the testing frame work involves a few Python modules. These need to be added to both &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pytest&amp;gt;=2.8.0
hypothesis==1.16.0
pytest-runner==2.6.2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is setting up some quick integration with &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, so that users can run &lt;code&gt;python setup.py test&lt;/code&gt; and execute your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, add (or edit) the &lt;code&gt;setup_requires&lt;/code&gt; list to include &lt;code&gt;pytest-runner&lt;/code&gt;. Add (or edit) the &lt;code&gt;tests_require&lt;/code&gt; list to include &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;. I also added the following to my &lt;code&gt;setup.cfg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[aliases]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I modified my &lt;code&gt;setup_requires&lt;/code&gt; list a bit, so that it's conditional. Since this would install the &lt;code&gt;pytest-runner&lt;/code&gt; on every call to &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, even when the module wouldn't be called, I wanted the runner to only be required when &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; is utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;needs_pytest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pytest'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'test'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ptr'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;intersection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest_runner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pytest-runner'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;needs_pytest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup_requires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#... Other requirements here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest_runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to test that my tests were working correctly. I created a &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; directory, which is where I plan on storing all of my test cases. &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; will find any files that start or end with &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; and execute them. I created a very simple &lt;code&gt;test_tests.py&lt;/code&gt; file with the following simple test (taken from the &lt;a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#writing-tests"&gt;Hypothesis Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;@given(st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_ints_are_commutative(x, y):
    assert x + y == y + x
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Travis CI needs to be told what to do. Modify the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; key to include &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;script:
   - py.test
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a successful run through Travis, you'll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tests/test_tests.py .
=========================== 1 passed in 0.26 seconds ===========================
The command "py.test" exited with 0.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="custom-domain"&gt;Custom Domain&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#custom-domain" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my own domain name. I want to utilize OpenShift with one of those domains, instead of the default one provided. Since I've using the free tier, that will rule out using the SSL certificate that is wildcarded to the whole &lt;code&gt;rhcloud.com&lt;/code&gt; domain. I can live with this. If I need SSL on my domain, I'll upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up OpenShift to use your domain, log into the web console. Go to the gear you are configuring. At the top, where the full domain is displayed, is the option to "Change". Select that option. Input the full domain (and subdomain) you want to utilize and click "Save". After a few seconds, you'll get a notification that the alias was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to configure the DNS records. I &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html"&gt;utilize&lt;/a&gt; CloudFlare for my domains, so the instructs will be specific to that, but should apply to any DNS system. Login to your management system and go to the area where you can specify DNS records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my test, I set up a subdomain of one of my domains as the alias I wanted to use. In your DNS system, set up a CNAME that points to the original hostname on OpenShift. The CNAME should be the subdomain you told OpenShift about. Save the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFlare recognized this immediately and redirected me to my Flask application. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, the set up is complete. You have a Flask application, connected to MySQL, that is integrated with a CI system which automatically deploys to OpenShift when all tests pass and uses CloudFlare (because I already was doing so), to provide a CDN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to building something!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="technical"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm running for moderator on Stack Overflow again</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-18T09:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-12-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-11-18:/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow is having a second election this year. I'm throwing my hat in the ring again. This entry follows the process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html"&gt;I ran for moderator&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow and didn't make it through the primaries. That's ok though, there were several very good users that did get &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/6"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt;. In a surprise announcement, though, Stack Overflow is running a second election this year. This is the first time this has happened since 2011. I'm still interested in a position and I'm still active in the community, so I'm going to run again. This post will follow the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last time, the nomination phase began with users throwing their hat into the ring. Nominations were slower and fewer this time. Only 19 nominees, so no one was eliminated due to low reputation. Several users from the last election are rerunning too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-platform"&gt;My Platform&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-platform" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/7#post-33617646"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; hasn't changed much since the previous run. Below is my nomination post. This time, I tried to pull emphasis off the automated script by putting it lower on the list of things I've done and instead focused on the moderation tasks I do on Stack Overflow and the work I've done on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;. We'll see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, I'm &lt;strong&gt;Andy&lt;/strong&gt; and I'd make a great moderator for Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-vote-for-me"&gt;Why vote for me?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-vote-for-me" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm active in the review queues (currently holding 10th in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/stats"&gt;Low Quality Post reviewers&lt;/a&gt; of all time), provide edits to posts, &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=answers"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the moderation aspect of Stack Exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;CommunityBuilding&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a year and a half. I know the moderator tools and have worked with several of the current moderators. This interaction will continue as a new moderator here. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've built an automated script that continues to handle &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;noisy comments&lt;/a&gt; very &lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GK32p.png"&gt;accurately&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; on Meta.SO that shows I'm involved in the meta aspect of the site as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a history of good community moderation already. I enjoy the moderation aspect on Stack Overflow (and Stack Exchange in general). I deal with users with respect, even if our opinions on an issue differ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I received my "candidate score". It was 33/40. Not the highest, but better than last time. The score wasn't mentioned in April. I am not expecting it to be an issue this time either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/november_2015_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated November 21, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary phase is in the third day. In day 1, I was hovering around 9th/10th place. Overnight, between days 1 and 2 though, I dropped down to 11th. I've been sitting here consistantly for a full day now and, while still gaining votes, I'm not gaining as fast as 10th position. It appears I may not make the cutoff by Friday's deadline. While disappointing, there are a few things that I came away with that I'm very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last primary, I revieved 1,492 positive votes. I've surpassed that already. I've over 2,100 currently. I'm pleased with that upswing. I was also more prepared for the questionnaire portion of the primaries this time. I've gotten the second highest number of upvotes on my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/310357/189134"&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the questions were similar to last time, but there are a few that I think should be included in the future elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="questionnaire"&gt;Questionnaire&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#questionnaire" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first question is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; post for candidates. It allows them to show off their involvement in Meta and show their best work. For users, it gives them a sense of how a candidate interacts with the community. I am very surprised that several candidates list only one or two posts. This seems to be doing a disservice to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Meta posts that you're particularly proud of, or that you feel best demonstrate your moderation style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm proud of several of my posts both here on Meta.SO and on other network sites I participate in. Here on MSO, I have two questions that I am proud of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;Can a machine be taught to flag comments automatically?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them"&gt;I estimate 10% of the links posted here are dead. How do we deal with them?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these, you can see that I care about quality on Stack Overflow. I've spent time analyzing the problem, as I see it, and present my findings to the community. I participated in the discussions that both posts generated and &lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQoP5.png"&gt;continue to run&lt;/a&gt; the bot to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on the network, my participation in meta has helped to shape communities. For example, on &lt;a href="http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com"&gt;Hardware Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, my meta post about &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/81/57"&gt;"What type of hardware is allowed"&lt;/a&gt; helped to set the scope of what the community accepts as on topic hardware. I've also helped to set up the &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/206/57"&gt;high quality guidelines for questions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/274/57"&gt;argued against certain types of tags&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/257/57"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these, I've presented my arguments and logic and strived to remain professional. I believe the community on HardwareRecs has seen that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;, I've been involved in many &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/users/78/andy?tab=summary"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;. I was involved in the discussions to &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/175/78"&gt;rename&lt;/a&gt; the community from Moderators.SE to CommunityBuilding.SE. I've been involved in discussions about slow &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/151/78"&gt;growth of the community&lt;/a&gt;. I've also presented &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/1274/78"&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; that go against other moderators, and walked away still feeling like a moderation team. (Go communication!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on OpenSource, I made a &lt;a href="http://meta.opensource.stackexchange.com/q/642/22"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how moderators had implemented a policy to watch the reviewers. It was similar to the long removed "flag weight" option that used to exist. I believe the post was presented in a way that questioned the decisions of the moderators, yet remained professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these meta posts, across the network, I think you can pick up on my moderation style and personality. I like data and I try to present my thoughts in a way that is understandable to all. I'm also willing to speak my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second question I struggled with for a bit. I've had ideas on how Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange could improve, but what did I want to present in this response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could add/revise one Stack Overflow policy/guideline, what would you change? Why would you change it, and what would it mean for the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to this question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of talking myself out of a position, I think more community moderation would help the problem that Stack Overflow has with scaling moderators. There are a couple areas that I think would work well in opening this to the higher reputation users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment flagging: Comments can be removed if enough users flag a comment. If not, a moderator needs to handle the flag. Instead, opening this as a review queue can remove a lot of this burden from the moderators. Users could handle all but the "Other..." flag. There may be guidance needed on the "Obsolete" one due to the difference between "obsolete comment" and "obsolete code block" differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audit Review reviews: On Stack Overflow, we get a decent number of &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/disputed-review-audits"&gt;disputed audit review&lt;/a&gt; posts on meta. There may be a way to get users with a history of passing both audits and good reviews involved in dealing with these disputed audits. The idea would be to say whether an audit is good or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes, and other areas where the community could be leveraged for moderation tasks, helps to remove the burden on moderators. Handling 2,000 (and growing) flags a day means that something needs to change. Moderators are exception handlers. They should be handling the cases that are exceptional - not comments that are no longer relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the community, this would be more &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252844/make-comment-flags-less-stupid"&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; with the moderation aspect. Users would be able to more quickly clean up a comment thread. Flag it and it appears in the review queue. From here, the moderators don't need to be involved. The downside of this is that it adds another queue for users to be involved with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="primary-results"&gt;Primary Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the primaries over, I ended with &lt;strong&gt;2483&lt;/strong&gt; positive votes. This put me in 11th place. Sadly, this was not enough to get into the election. I was 185 votes shy of over taking 10th. Good luck to the candidates that made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Live Vote Counter at the end of the Primary" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/2015-11-21_22_43_25-SO_2015_Election_Vote_Monitor.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tools that came out of this election was a way to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310694/189134"&gt;visualize&lt;/a&gt; various data points to compare candidates. I provided a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/310736/189134"&gt;couple notes about outliers&lt;/a&gt; various candidates show regarding aspects on the site. I found it interesting to see what each user had "specialized" in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election"&gt;Election&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated December 8, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election is over and the new moderators have settled in. We've had our first bout of public drama over one of these moderators actually moderating a chat room too. &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was closer to the top 10 this time, but still missed it. Even more surprising was that the user that ended up in 3rd in the primaries didn't even come close to getting elected. He was eliminated in the 5th round of final STV votes. I still think I'd make a great moderator for Stack Overflow, but I need to figure out the best way to promote myself in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>How not to recruit me</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-not-to-recruit-me.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-10-10T14:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-10-10T14:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-10-10:/how-not-to-recruit-me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In which I discuss ways not to send me a recruitment message if you are interested in me working for you&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, on Meta.StackOverflow, a product manager &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/307674/189134"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for feedback on how they could make first contact between employers and potential employees more valuable to the potential employee. I provided my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/307687/189134"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;. I've reposted it below, with some minor changes to further explain my ideals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary of this entire post is: If I have to spend time to make my resume jump out and catch &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; attention, I expect you to spend just a little bit of time telling me about your company and the position you are recruiting for. I don't think a few sentences with these details is that much ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-i-want-to-see"&gt;What I want to see&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-i-want-to-see" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know what the company does and I want to know who you are. I also want to know what positions you are looking to fill and a few details about the position are also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="messages-ive-recieved"&gt;Messages I've recieved&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#messages-ive-recieved" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-1"&gt;Message 1&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the start of a good message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 1" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/message1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has the following good elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who the recruiter is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position they are recruiting for &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not offer the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the company does (other than "build great software").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation which of my skills or experiences they are interested in. Are you interested in my Python answers on Stack Overflow? My projects on Github? My PHP experience from years ago? This is &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; to know. If the company is looking to recruit me for knowledge I shared years ago (ie. PHP in my case), I'd probably be less useful right now because I haven't used PHP in years. I have not kept up with recent changes to the language or various frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation of what the position will do, projects I'll be involved in, or challenges they are facing now that I'll help solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not respond to this position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-2"&gt;Message 2&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-2" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 2" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/message2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the following useful elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know your name, position and company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to who the company was in this particular message, I am even vaguely aware of what the company does. Name recognition helps, but is not very high on my list of &lt;em&gt;"important things"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does not have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of the position. "Looking for top talent...to make a significant impact on our systems". Ok. How? What will I be doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you find me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually talked to this recruiter and I have to say that I'm both disappointed in the company and myself for not noticing some red flags in this message. This wasn't an interview for a specific position. This was a general recruiting email and I suspect it was sent to multiple users. Flags that I missed in the message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of any details at all and use of buzzwords ("top technical talent", "fast paced", "start-up like", "eCommerce industry").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion about personal career goals and technical background. Some of my back ground should be obvious from my Careers profile, SO profile and links on both. More importantly, I missed the "personal career goals" flag. The details they wanted were to see if my goals aligned with any open positions they had at the time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the discussion took place, the recruiter knew little more than my name. There were no questions about my careers profile (at the very least) or other projects I mentioned on my profile. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-3"&gt;Message 3&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-3" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 3" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/message3.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message isn't useful to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is this company and what do they do? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no experience in mobile apps. How did they find me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Chad's relationship to the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this message showed up because I work for one of their largest clients, live 10 miles from their office and work, literally, right across the street from them. I didn't know that at the time though. I had to ask a co-worker if they'd ever heard of the company. They pointed out their office at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not respond this this message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-4"&gt;Message 4&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-4" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 4" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/message4.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message is worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are seeking employees who are willing to relocate. Great. Good for you. Are you interested in my skills or just a warm body to keep your chairs warm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No details about the company, other than a link to a web site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No name at all. Who am I talking to? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No details about the job. I hope they found someone to hold their seats to the floor 8 hours a day. If not, I recommend large rocks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-the-messages"&gt;Summary of the messages&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-the-messages" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need &lt;em&gt;details&lt;/em&gt; and I need details more than what the salary is going to be. Obviously, I need to do some research about your company, if I've never heard of you. But, throw me a bone. Tell me a bit about your self. I had to make a fancy resume to get you to reach out to me. I did something that caught your eye. Now, do something that will catch mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't need to work at a company that is the next Google or Apple or start up flush with cash. But, I do want to know about the company before I talk to you. If you can't spend a few seconds explaining a bit about the company, I don't want to talk with you. I don't think a few sentences is that much to offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here at COMPANY NAME, we are looking for a POSITION with skills in LANGUAGE or experience in INDUSTRY. I see you have both and think you'd be able to help TEAM NAME with their on going project of MAKING THE WORLD BETTER. Your PROJECT ON GITHUB looks like you've dealt with aspects of this problem before. We've gotten some press recently about our innovations in this area (check them out HERE)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-my-attention"&gt;How to get my attention&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-my-attention" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the post above makes it clear what &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work. The companies that I've responded to (other than message 2, above) have all done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicate they've at least looked at my resume by commenting on some aspect of it. I've had recruiters mention projects I've done, jobs I've held, or individual bullet points that caught their attention. This is great. It means you aren't reaching out to me because I happened to hit all of your keywords when the resume passed through your Human Resources department.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a short description of the job they want to fill. I don't need a full job posting. A link to such a posting is sufficient. However, if you could summarize it in a sentence or two, that'd make both of our lives easier. Reading full job descriptions isn't the most fun thing in the world and often have industry (or even company) specific acronyms. That isn't helpful to either of us, because I may not know them. Just tell me what your team does within the company. That's good enough to get my attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to me like a person, not some number that a database search returned. As a hint, if you can figure out that I like to go by "Andy", instead of "Andrew", you've already done a far better job than most recruiters I've spoken with. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last two posts, I've discussed the number of &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;rotten links&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow and a &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;proposal to fix said links&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I'm going to discuss how I performed this analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-up"&gt;Set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-database"&gt;The database&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-database" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process began by downloading the March 2013 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange"&gt;data dump&lt;/a&gt;. I loaded the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; into a [MariaDB] instance on my local machine. This was accomplished with a very simple script and patience, as the script took a while to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;load xml local infile '/path/to/posts.xml'
into table posts
rows identified by '&amp;lt;row&amp;gt;';
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-data"&gt;The data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, the next step was selecting my random sample of data. I did this by randomly selecting 25% of the days in a year and then pulling all posts for those days across all years of Stack Overflow's existence. The Python script I used to do this was fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;random_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;total_seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;366&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dayslist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;xrange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dayslist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this run, the days that I cared about are in the &lt;code&gt;dayslist&lt;/code&gt; variable. I used that to pull questions and answers from the database that were created on that month/day combination. In the end, this resulted in just over 25% of the total posts being selected. To ensure that I could replicate the results, I also saved the dates that were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="parsing-the-data"&gt;Parsing the data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#parsing-the-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to parse out links from the data. I used the following script to extract anchor text and links from a post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;def links_in_post(post):
    """
    Returns a list of all links found
    :param posts: A list of dictionaries with a 'body' key containing HTML strings
     [
        {
            'body': "&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is HTML&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;"
        },
    ]
    :return: A list of tuples containing anchor text and URL
        [
            ('Display Text', 'http://example.com')
        ]
    """
    logging.debug("Extracting links...")
    links = []
    images = []
    regexp = "&lt;span class="ni"&gt;&amp;amp;.+?;&lt;/span&gt;"
    list_of_html = re.findall(regexp, post)
    for e in list_of_html:
        if e in invalid_entities:
            h = HTMLParser.HTMLParser()
            unescaped = h.unescape(e) 
            post = post.replace(e, unescaped)

    doc = html.fromstring(post)
    for link in doc.xpath('//a'):
        links.append(Link(text=link.text_content(), link=link.get('href')))
    for image in doc.xpath('//img'):
        images.append(Link(text=image.get('alt'), link=image.get('src')))
    all_items = links + images
    seen = set()
    unique_items = [item for item in all_items if item[1] not in seen and not seen.add(item[1])]
    return unique_items
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular expression being utilized, is to strip out HTML entities. This was needed due to weird parsing issues with non-ASCII characters. Fortunately, I wasn't the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13939198/189134"&gt;first to encounter oddities like this&lt;/a&gt;. The list comprehension at the end of the function is returning only unique tuples of anchor text/link. I was surprised how often I'd end up with tuples such as &lt;code&gt;('this', 'http://google.com')&lt;/code&gt; in the same post. This uniqueness saved a lot of processing time later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all links in a post had been extracted, this information and information about the post itself, was saved to the database. If a post had no links, it was not saved. The database consisted of three tables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links - This table contains the base URLs seen in all posts. URLs are distinct. It also contains an ID that will be utilized for linking to the other tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post Links - This table contains information about links in a post. This includes the specific anchor text/link combinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link Results - This table contains the results of link status checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing the posts was fairly time consuming, but was able to be parallelized easily. That significantly cut down on processing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="checking-the-links"&gt;Checking the links&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#checking-the-links" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most time consuming portion of this entire project was actually checking link status. Each link that appeared in the &lt;code&gt;Links&lt;/code&gt; table was checked. As I mentioned in my first post, the original idea was to simply send a &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request to each URL. The idea was to save myself and the end point a tiny amount of bandwidth. I had over a million links to process. I figured a little saved bandwidth wouldn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turns out this isn't a good idea. When I started seeing larger sites as not being accessible, I go suspicious that something was wrong. These sites were returning status 405 errors. This indicates that the method is not allowed. So, I switched to &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; for every link. The next problem I ran into was that many sites didn't like the default user agent of the spider. They rejected requests with 404 and 401 errors. In the end, I got around this by mimicking Firefox on every request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those kinks worked out, every link was sent a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request that looked to be from a Firefox browser. The process would allow 20 seconds per link. If the link didn't respond in that time limit, it was declared inaccessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, I repeated the process with anything that hadn't returned a status code less than 400. Once more, on the third week, I repeated this with the failed links. At the end of three weeks, I had a list of sites that were inaccessible to me - on a residential connection - three times over a period of three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"&gt;SVG image&lt;/a&gt; that I created for the write up was generated with Pygal. The tables were the result of various break downs of the data via queries to the status results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up"&gt;Wrap up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#wrap-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rather proud of how the results turned out for this project. I went into it expecting about 15% of links to be broken, but I didn't really realize what the meant. Fifteen percent of 21 million total posts is over 3 million. That's a large number. BUT, it also ignored that a large percentage of posts don't contain links. I failed to consider that in my original hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than half of my sample had links (2.3M out of 5.6M). Of the 2.3M with links, only 1.5M were unique links. The final result of 10% failed links makes much more sense in this context. Ten percent of 1.5M links means that there are 150K links that are bad. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>A proposal to fix broken links on Stack Overflow</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-07T07:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-07T07:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-07:/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My proposal to decrease the number of broken links on Stack Overflow&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This post was &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on August 7th, 2015. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; about how many links on Stack Overflow are starting to rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-proposal"&gt;The proposal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-proposal" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301002/189134"&gt;another hybrid&lt;/a&gt; of the previous &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224895/what-happened-to-the-broken-link-review-queue"&gt;broken link&lt;/a&gt; queue (as was mentioned &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them#comment229798_300916"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them#comment229795_300916"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/300998/189134"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/300996/189134"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;) and an automated process to fix broken links with an archived version (which has also been &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301001/189134"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broken link queue should focus on editing and fixing the links in a post (as opposed to closing it). It'd be similar to the suggested edits queue, but with the focus intended to correct &lt;em&gt;links&lt;/em&gt; not spelling and grammar. This could be done by only allowing a user to edit the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility, I envision is presenting the user with the links in the post and a status on whether or not the link is available. If it's not available, give the user a way to change that specific link. Utilizing &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2054063/189134"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, I have a quick mock up of what I propose such a review task looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-queue"&gt;The Queue&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-queue" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenlinkqueue.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Broken Link Mock up" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenlinkqueue.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the links that appear in the post are on the right hand side of the screen. The links that are accessible have a green check mark. The ones that are broken (and the reason for being in this queue) have a red X. When a user elects to fix a post, they are presented with a modal showing only the broken URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-automation"&gt;The Automation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-automation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this queue, though, I think an automated process would be helpful as well. The idea is that this would operate similarly to the Low Quality queue, where the system can automatically add a post to the queue if certain criteria are met &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a user can flag a post as having broken links. I've based my idea on what Tim Post outlined in the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130398/does-stack-exchange-crawl-websites/198357#comment741544_198357"&gt;comments to a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated process performs a "Today in History" type check. This keeps the fixes limited to a small subset of posts per day. It also focuses on older posts, which were more likely to have a broken link than something posted recently. Example: On July 31, 2015, the only posts being checked for bad links would be anything posted on July 31 in any year 2008 through current year - 1. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing the &lt;a href="http://archive.org/about/wayback_api.php"&gt;Wayback Machine API&lt;/a&gt;, or similar service, the system attempts to change broken links into an archived version of the URL. This archived version should probably be from "close" to the time the post was originally made. If the automated process isn't able to find an archived version of the link, the post should be tossed into the Broken Link queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Community edits a post to fix a link, a new Post History event is utilized to show that a link was changed. This would allow anyone looking at revision history to easily see that a specific change was only to fix links. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions performed in the previous bullets are exposed to 10K users in the moderator tools. Much like recent close/delete posts show up, these do as well. This allows higher rep users to spot check (if they so desire). I think this portion is important when the automated process fixes a link. For community edits in the queue, the history tab in &lt;code&gt;/review&lt;/code&gt; seems sufficient. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a post consists of a large percentage of a link (or links) and these links were changed by Community, the post should have further action taken on it in some queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:
     - A post where X+% of the text is hyperlinks is very dependant on the links being active. If one or more of the links are broken, the post may no longer be relevant (or may be a link only post). One example I found while doing this was &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/4906230/revisions"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this type of edit from the Community user should bump a post to the front page. Edits done in the broken link queue, though, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; bump the post just like a suggested edit does today. By preventing the automated Community posts from being bumped, we prevent the the front page from being flooded, daily, with old posts and these edits. I think that the exposure in the 10K tools and the broken link queue will provide the visibility needed to check the process is working correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="potential-pitfalls"&gt;Potential pitfalls&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#potential-pitfalls" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated link checking will likely run into several of the problems I did. Mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites modify the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request to send a 404 instead of a 405. My solution to this was to issue &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests for everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites don't like certain user agents. My solution to this was to mimic the Firefox user agent. To be a good internet citizen, Stack Exchange probably shouldn't go that far, but providing a unique user agent that is easily identifiable as "StackExchangeBot" (think "GoogleBot"), should be helpful in identifying where traffic is coming from. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites that are down one week and up another. I solved this by spreading my tests over a period of 3 weeks. With the queue and automatic linking to an archived version of the site, this may not be necessary. However, immediately converting a link to an archived copy should be discussed by the community. Do we convert the broken link immediately? Or do we try again in X days. If it's still down then convert it? It was suggested in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301002/189134"&gt;another answer&lt;/a&gt; that we first offer the poster the chance to make changes before an automatic process takes place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to throttle requests so that you don't flood a site with requests. I solved this by only querying unique URLs. This still issues a lot of requests to certain, popular, domains. This could be solved by staggering the checks over a period of minutes/hours versus spewing 100s - 1000s of &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests at midnight daily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the broken link queue, I feel the first two would be acceptable. Much like posts in the Low Quality queue appear because of a heuristic, despite not being low quality, links will be the same way. The system will flag them as broken and the queue will determine if that is true (if an archived version of the site can't be found by the automated process). The bullet about throttling requests is an implementation detail that I'm sure the developers would be able to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Analysis of links posted to Stack Overflow</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-06T07:35:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-06:/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10% of 1.5M randomly selected unique links in the Stack Overflow March 2015 data dump are unavailable.

&lt;p&gt;This post was &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on August 6th, 2015. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Approximately 10% of 1.5M randomly selected unique links in the March 2015 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange"&gt;data dump&lt;/a&gt; are unavailable. To be more precise, that is approximately 150K dead links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running into more and more links that are dead on Stack Overflow and it's bothering me. In some cases, I've spent the time hunting down a replacement, in others I've notified the owner of the post that a link is dead, and (more shamefully), in others I've simply ignored it and left just a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/262040/189134"&gt;down vote&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously that's not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making sweeping generalizations that there are dead links everywhere, though, I wanted to make sure I wasn't just finding bad posts because I was wandering through the review queues. Utilizing the March 2015 data dump, I randomly selected about 25% of the posts (both questions and answers) and then parsed out the links. This works out to 5.6M posts out of 21.7M total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these 5.6M posts, 2.3M contained links and 1.5M of these were unique links. I sent each unique URL a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods"&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; request, with a user agent mimicking Firefox&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. I then retested everything that didn't return a successful response a week later. Finally, anything that failed from &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; batch, I resent a final test a week later. If a site was down in all three tests, I considered it down for this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results2"&gt;Results&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results2" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-status-code"&gt;By status code&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-status-code" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news/Bad News: A majority of the links returned a valid response, but there are still roughly 10% that failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="PIE CHART IMAGE" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(This image is showing the top status codes returned)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three largest slices of the pie are the status 200s (site working!), status 404 (page not found, but server responded saying the page isn't found) and Connection Errors. Connection errors are sites that had no proper server response. The request to access the page timed out. I was generous in the time out and allowed a request to live for 20 seconds before failing a link with this status. The &lt;code&gt;4xx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5xx&lt;/code&gt; errors are status codes that fall in the 400 and 500 range of HTTP responses. These are client and server error ranges, thus counted as a failure. &lt;code&gt;2xx&lt;/code&gt; errors (of which was are in the low triple) are pages that responded with a success message in the 200 range, but it wasn't a &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; code. Finally, there were just over a hundred sites that hit a redirect loop that didn't seem to end. These are the &lt;code&gt;3xx&lt;/code&gt; errors. I failed a site with this range if it redirected more than 30 times. There are a negligible number of sites that returned status codes in the 600 and &lt;a href="https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc"&gt;700&lt;/a&gt; range&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-most-common"&gt;By most common&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-most-common" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, expectedly, many URLs that failed that appeared frequently in the sample set. Below is a list of the top 50&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; URLs that are in posts most often, but failed three times over the course of three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do with all of this? How do we, as a community, solve the issue of 10% of our outbound links pointing to places on the internet that no longer exist? Assuming that my sample was indicative of the entire data dump, there are close to 600K (150K broken unique links x 4, because I took 1/4 of the data dump as a sample) broken links posted in questions and answers on Stack Overflow. I assume a large number of links posted in comments would be broken as well, but that's an activity for another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage posters to provide snippets from their links just in case a link dies. That definitely helps, but the resources behind the links and the (presumably) expanded explanation behind the links are still gone. How can we properly deal with this? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like there have been a few previous discussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/198357/186281"&gt;Utilize the Wayback API to automatically fix broken links.&lt;/a&gt; Development appeared to stall on this due to the large number of edits the Community user would be making. This would also hide posts that depended on said link from being surfaced for the community to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224895/what-happened-to-the-broken-link-review-queue"&gt;Link review queue&lt;/a&gt;. It was in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212023/where-can-i-access-the-link-validation-review-queue"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;, but disappeared in early 2014. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/174347/badge-request-for-fixing-dead-links-pipefitter"&gt;Badge proposal for fixing broken links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#footnotes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how it ultimately played out. Originally I sent &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; requests, in an effort to save bandwidth. This turned out to waste a whole bunch of time because there are a whole bunch of sites around the internet that return a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error"&gt;&lt;code&gt;405 Method Not Allowed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when sending a &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request. The next step was to sent &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests, but utilize the default Python &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; user-agent. A lot of sites were returning &lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; responses to this user agent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to Stack Exchange sites were not counted in the above results. The failures seen are almost 100% due to a question/answer/comment being deleted. The process ran as an anonymous user, thus didn't have any reputation and was served a 404. A user with appropriate permissions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still visit the link. I verified a number of 404'd links to Stack Overflow posts and this was the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4th most common failure was to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. The 16th and 17th most common were &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; on ports other than 80. I removed these from the result table with the knowledge that these shouldn't be accessible from the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There where 7 total URLs that returned status codes in the &lt;code&gt;600&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc"&gt;&lt;code&gt;700&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; range. One such site was &lt;a href="http://learn.code.org/hoc/1"&gt;code.org&lt;/a&gt; with a status code of 752. Sadly, this is not even defined the joke RFC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="follow-up"&gt;Follow up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#follow-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a proposal on how I think this could be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>How I set up this site with GitHub Pages and CloudFlare</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-09T11:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-07-09T11:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-07-09:/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post provides a brief description of how I set up the web site to utilize GitHub Pages and CloudFlare and eliminated my self hosting&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I described why I moved from Wordpress to Pelican for my blog. This one goes a step further and describes how I eliminated the 
need for the dedicated server I'd been utilizing as a part of &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;Team Vipers&lt;/a&gt;. By eliminating that server, I reduced my costs to zero but kept control 
over the DNS of my domain (thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;) and had an easier method of updating the site using &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-pages-setup"&gt;GitHub Pages Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#github-pages-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize GitHub Pages, I needed to create a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that followed the format &lt;code&gt;GitHubUsername.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. This repository would house the 
content that is this site. I also set up a second &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; which contains the source for the blog. This repository includes the templates, plugins
and markdown version of the pages. The first repository was set up as submodule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io.git output
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignored the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; on the source repository. Finally, I had to adjust &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; slightly to  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = False
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this, I was constantly destroying the output repository and had to reinitialize it. This prevents that from occuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a new post consists of writing up the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/master/content/2015_07_09_how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.md"&gt;Markdown page&lt;/a&gt;, generating the page with the command below (or the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/generate_content_production.bat"&gt;batch script&lt;/a&gt;) and then committing and
pushing the changes to the submodule to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Generates HTML files without debugging information
pelican content --output output --settings publishconf.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new content is available immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="custom-domain"&gt;Custom Domain&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#custom-domain" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the URL for this site isn't &lt;code&gt;awegnergithub.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, but instead &lt;code&gt;andrewwegner.com&lt;/code&gt;. To accomplish this, I added a directory to the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;
named &lt;code&gt;extra&lt;/code&gt;. In this directory is a single file named &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/content/extra/CNAME"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (no extension). In the file is my domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I had to modify &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/pelicanconf.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to add the &lt;code&gt;extra/CNAME&lt;/code&gt; to the static path and then on generation move the &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; file from this subdirectory to the root.
I could have put it in the root of &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; by default, but Pelican provides a way to do this and it keeps &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; clean. &lt;strong&gt;One very important note&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;EXTRA_PATH_METADATA&lt;/code&gt; is
operating system sensitive. Since I am generating the content on a Windows machine, I had to use a backslash instead of the forward slash the documentation shows. I found this
after posing a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30512242/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow on why it wasn't working as the documentation suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two important fields to add or edit are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...
STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'extra/CNAME']
...
EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {'extra\CNAME': {'path': 'CNAME'},}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cloudflare-setup"&gt;Cloudflare Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#cloudflare-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thing I needed in order to get rid of my server was control over DNS. I could revert back to GoDaddy, but after a little research found that CloudFlare's additional CDN and 
security was a "good thing" (because, you know, I'm such a highly traffic'd blog these days). Step one was signing up to CloudFlare. This was a 3-5 minute thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once signed up and signed in, I went to set up DNS. This was as simple as adding my domain name and waiting for CloudFlare to import my existing DNS records. With this, I kept by Google Apps
email intact (which is what I was most concerned with). Next, I went and removed the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; records. I replaced these with &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; records pointing to my GitHub Pages URL. I also added a &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; CNAME 
pointing to the same location. Since I have Pelican configured to strip it with the setting below, it doesn't matter other than people expect to enter &lt;code&gt;www dot domain dot com&lt;/code&gt; in their URL bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SITEURL = 'http://andrewwegner.com'
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, I had to point by name servers to CloudFlare instead of my dedicated server. They provide a list of registratars to choose from. Select your registrar and follow the instructions. My biggest
issue here was remembering my GoDaddy password. After I made it into my account, the steps to change name servers were very simple. Once those are saved, you wait for the changes to propagate and
enjoy your new GitHub Pages / CloudFlare web page for free. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="technical"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I moved from Wordpress to Pelican</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-03T22:41:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T22:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-05-03:/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief summary of why I dropped Wordpress and moved to Pelican&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I maintained a Wordpress blog covering various things I've done or created. Most of these revolved around
things I created to make administering Team Vipers easier for me and for the rest of the admin team. It was my way
of documenting what I'd done (in case I ever needed to do it again) and providing a way to update the Team Vipers community
about new plugins or applications that would be deployed to the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-issues-with-wordpress"&gt;My Issues with Wordpress&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-issues-with-wordpress" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I had with Wordpress was that it was just to bulky for the simple posts I was making. I needed a database, a full web
server (or a hosting provider), and either time to hunt for the "perfect" plugin(s) or PHP knowledge to do it myself. Early in my
development career, I used PHP a lot. That was part of the reason I chose Wordpress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! I know that language. If I ever need something, I can just whip it up myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Me, before the real world ambushed me and beat me with a stick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="spam"&gt;Spam&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent time setting up Wordpress. I picked out a theme, plugins, and started saving future me with documentation. Then life happened. For whatever
reason, I stopped updating Wordpress. My blog sat out there for weeks or months unvisited by anyone. Then, one morning, my phone vibrated
and told me that I had a new comment on my site. Woo! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was spam. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I marked it spam and moved on with my day. Later that morning, I glanced at my phone again. 32 emails. I am just not that popular. Something
was wrong. Turns out, a spam bot found me. I sighed and then removed all the comments and checked the box indicating that users had to
be registered to post. That solved my problem for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the bots got smarter. They started registering. They started posting legitimate looking messages, except for that associated URL their name
would link to in the comments. They pulled keywords out of the post and formulated a somewhat passable English question using those words. The spam
prevention plugins I installed would slow the tide for a few weeks. The bots would adapt and then I'd be awash with spam posts again. Eventually,
the solution was to completely disable comments. I'd spent way to much time dealing with spam on a blog that received very little legitimate traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't utilize the comments, Pelican provides a nice simple page that I can post my thoughts and not worry about getting hit by a spam bot. It also
provides plugins so that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include comments should I ever choose to do so in the future. For the time being, though, I have a nice simple page 
with no comments. That's exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="security"&gt;Security&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch any technology web sites, you'll notice that there are vulnerabilities found in Wordpress frequently. These require patches,
which requires me to do something. It may be as simple as logging in and clicking a button to update, but it is still something I need to 
remember to do for a relatively minor site. When I'd log in to clear the spam backlog, I'd frequently also install updates for 10-20 plugins, themes or
Wordpress itself. It was mostly painless, but I didn't like the idea of the site sitting there vulnerable for weeks at a time because I didn't
visit and login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of Wordpress and the underlying database exposed a fairly sizable target for a web page so small. Pelican generates static
HTML pages. I don't have to worry about SQL injections, unauthorized logins, or anything else. I host a basic set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 
That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="php-vs-python"&gt;PHP vs Python&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#php-vs-python" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I used to use PHP frequently. It was my go to language. I picked Wordpress with the idea that I'd be able to hack together features I needed.
The reality, it turns out, was that I wasn't actually interested in doing that. Instead, I picked out plugins that were close enough to the
exact functionality I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I transferred to a job where I used Python. Instead of having a language I used on the side (PHP) and a job where I was a glorified project manager, without the 
actual title of "Project Manager", I now had a job where I used a language (Python) for 8 hours a day. My usage of PHP plummeted. I found I could get what I wanted
done in my side projects faster and easier with Python. At work I used Python to build tools for engineering problems. At home, I started using it for every day
tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I realized I hadn't used PHP for several versions of the language. My knowledge of the language was outdated. The biggest reason I'd chosen Wordpress was no longer
relevant, because I couldn't write anything complicated in PHP without glancing at documentation to do even simple things. It's sad that I lost the intimate knowledge of
a language, but I feel that I've been more productive with Python anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is written in Python. Even more importantly though, it generates HTML files which are hosted. I don't need to run a Python environment on a server. I just
need to host HTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#markdown" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've fought with Wordpress's text editor countless times. This happened most often when attempting to add code blocks. It was a pain to do. It was a pain
to fix when the blocks broke. Pelican supports Markdown. Markdown is supported by large organizations like GitHub, reddit and Stack Exchange. I use all three of those.
I know how to utilize Markdown to create code blocks, headers, insert images, create bulleted lists. All without needing to fight how the text editor is going to actually
save the data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="Pelican"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm running to be a moderator of Stack Overflow</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-06T22:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-04-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-04-06:/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm running for a Stack Overflow moderator position in April 2015. This entry follows the election process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#"&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; has over 130 sites in its network. Each of those sites has at least 3 moderators that are glorified &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;janitors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the moderation work is extremely mundane, almost janitorial. It’s deleting obvious spam, closing blatantly off-topic questions, and culling some of the worst rated posts in various dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal moderator does as little as possible. But those little actions may be powerful and highly concentrated. Judiciously limiting your use of moderator powers to selectively prune and guide the community — now that’s the true art of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works so well in the Stack Exchange network because the users are able to handle most moderation tasks. As users gain reputation, they gain privileges. With these privileges, they are better able to maintain and cultivate the content on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all activity can be performed by users though. This is where moderators come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/users/78/andy?tab=profile"&gt;&lt;img alt="Andy on Community Building" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/community_building_andy_flair.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have a diamond (♦) on the &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt; site. I was &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/138/78"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; one of the Pro Tempore moderators during the beta phase of the site. This is my first experience moderating on Stack Exchange, beyond what my reputation on Stack Overflow
gets me. &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/77/78"&gt;It is not, however, my first time moderating&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Community Building&lt;/em&gt; is focused on various aspects of building communities - both online and off. It caters to users from all aspects of a site (owners, moderators, users, advertisers and any thing else).
My experience here led me to pursuing a moderator position on Stack Overflow. This site is orders of magnitude larger than &lt;em&gt;Community Building&lt;/em&gt;. It has millions of users and millions of questions. With all this traffic, there are still only 18 diamond moderators. The
idea of community moderation shows that it scales well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election cycle begins with the nomination phase. Users nominate themselves for the position. In 1200 characters or less, you lay out your platform. In this phase, nearly anyone can nominate themselves. However, there are only 30 positions available. If more than 30 people
nominate themselves, then the users with the lowest reputation get bumped. With only 11K reputation, I am at the lower end of the spectrum of other nominees, but I am well above the lowest. I have the 8th lowest reputation. I've looked at previous election cycles. It seems unlikely
that there will be 30 or more nominees. I think that I am safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-platform"&gt;My Platform&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-platform" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted my &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/6#post-29480018"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the nomination phase opened. I stressed the work that I've already done on Stack Overflow and previous moderation experience on another Stack Exchange site (Community Building).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Andy and I want to be one of your moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why vote for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've built an automated script to handle &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;noisy comments&lt;/a&gt;. It runs daily, probably to the chagrin of the current moderators, but it helps keep the comments noise down and it is incredibly accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the automated flagging, I participate in the review queues, provide edits and post &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=answers"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a moderator of &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;"Community Building"&lt;/a&gt;, I know the tools used by the Stack Exchange sites. I've used this position to interact with the existing moderators for advise and questions. This interaction will not only continue but be helpful as a new moderator to SO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the flagging history and experience to make the appropriate judgement calls. I feel that is a positive attribute that will help me in helping you to have the best experience you can on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll continue to help improve the site regardless of whether I am elected or not. I will be able to do a much better job at that, though, as one of your moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I received my "candidate score". It was 29/40. Not the highest, but not the lowest either. I expect, if any one is concerned about this score, it will be mentioned it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nomination-phase-comments"&gt;Nomination Phase Comments&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase-comments" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 11, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments on my nomination post have focused mostly on the pros and cons of the automated script I built to flag comments. I was expecting this discussion. I'd classify most of the comments about the script as
"cautious". Users seem concerned about something completely automated used to moderate or that I focus on low priority content. My response to this concern was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] by automating the removal of this lower priority content it is easier to focus on the actively harmful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to point out that I have done more than "build a script". I've actively participated in review queues on Stack Overflow for years. I've flagged appropriate content
(with a high percentage marked as accepted). I have also been moderator on Community Building. All of this, in combination with the automation, makes up my "platform".
I have the experience of moderation, the knowledge of how the system works and the drive to improve the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also mentioned a few times that I'd be unlikely to utilize such an automated tool as a moderator. I promised to bring this concern up when I moved further into the election process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I received a few comments supporting either me or the work that I've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automation is very impressive - thanks for that, it's a real contribution to the quality of the site. That said - as a privileged user I suspect you won't be able to run these sort of scripts on your account for obvious reasons.  –  Benjamin Gruenbaum Apr 6 at 21:34&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can vouch for Andy's track record as a pro tem mod on Community Building. I want to note as well for the record that many of the main site questions and answers on Community Building are explicitly about moderation, and his contributions there also provide insight into his approach to the job. –  Air Apr 7 at 16:54&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh. I have to say I'm impressed. Putting you on my list of candidates to watch. –  Qix Apr 7 at 19:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to point out that your response to my concerns is fair and reasonable, as well as polite, even if it isn't quite exactly how I see things. It certainly alleviates my concerns of misusing moderator power. I will be seriously considering voting for you. –  jpmc26 Apr 8 at 6:41&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm pleased with how the discussion has gone. It has been a few days since there were comments left though. Hopefully a little interest picks up during the primary phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very impressed by the other candidates. There are many very good candidates that I'd be happy to work with (or be unashamed to lose to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 17, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nomination phases has ended. I have advanced to the primary phase. The purpose of this phase is to narrow the list of 30 candidates to 10. Those 10 will be the ones that can be voted on to be the next moderators. In the primary phase, users can vote nominees up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the election process, one of the other &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/616460/jason-c"&gt;candidates&lt;/a&gt; created several tools to help users see nominee activity. He also created a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290346/2015-election-live-vote-monitor"&gt;live vote monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It was exciting to hang out in the Election Chat room and watch votes roll in. The position of 10th was highly contested
toward the end of the primary. I was very pleased to see that everyone remained civil in the chat room too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended this phase with &lt;strong&gt;1492&lt;/strong&gt; positive votes. This put me in 15th. Sadly, not enough to advance to the election phase. However, there are several excellent candidates that did advance. Good luck to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Live Vote Counter at the end of the Primary" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_primary_live_vote.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-primary-data"&gt;Other Primary Data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#other-primary-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the primary phase involves answering questions that users have posed during the nomination phase. These questions were voted upon and the highest were included in the questionnaire. My &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290096/2015-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire/290122#290122"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; was removed at the end of this phase because I did not advance. I was
prepared with answers about my moderation style and my expectations for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other tools that was created during this cycle showed &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289995/2015-moderator-candidate-activity-profiles"&gt;nominee activity&lt;/a&gt; on the site over time. This was a quick way to compare nominees based on the number of activities they have performed on undeleted posts (because data related to deleted posts is removed from public view). It
provided, at a glance, a way to see who is and is not active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the charts of my activity that the tool created. The green vertical bar is account creation date. The orange/brown vertical bars are previous election windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stack Overflow Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_so_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
This is my activity chart for Stack Overflow itself. It shows that I've had an account since 2009, but didn't really start utilizing the site, more than occassionally, until 2013. Since then, it shows that a large majority of my
activity onsite is in the review queues. There are posts, revisions, comments and more along the bottom, but most of my activity is in the review queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Stack Overflow Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_mso_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Meta Stack Exchange Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_mse_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
My Meta Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange charts show a fairly low activity level. Unfortunately, I think this is obscuring the posts that I do make simply because of the large scale on the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Combined Activity Chart" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_combined_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
Finally, the last chart shows the combined activity across all three areas (SO, MSO, and MSE). It looks very similar to the Stack Overflow one because of the lower activity levels on the two Meta sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election-phase"&gt;Election Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 21, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election is over. Three great candidates were elected. One thing I am like about Stack Exchange's elections is their &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/77560/186281"&gt;usage of OpenSTV and the Meek STV method&lt;/a&gt;. The results of each round of the
election cycle are available at &lt;a href="http://www.opavote.org/results/4962933813542912/0"&gt;opavote.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most elections, there are known and unknown winners before the election even begins. The response that &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"&gt;Martijn Pieters&lt;/a&gt; received from the time he nominated through the final moments of the election all but guarenteed a victory for him. It is a
well deserved victory. I hope that he is able to keep up his frequent, high quality, answers in the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python"&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; tag. If not, his drop in activity will be felt. The surprise, to me, was &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1114/jeremy-banks"&gt;Jeremy Banks&lt;/a&gt;. He ended in 9th place in the primaries. That doesn't mean he can't do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've interacted with all three moderators on site and in chat prior to their victory. I've been very happy with those interactions. With their promotion, I look forward to working with them as a moderator on the Stack Exchange network in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the winners!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>Zephyr - The bot that watches for low quality vote requests</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-03-12T23:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-03-12:/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Find out about the bot that watches Stack Exchange chat rooms for requests to close low quality content&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange receives thousands of questions per day across all of their sites. Not all of these are high quality
posts. Fortunately, users of the Stack Exchange network are given &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; to help keep that low quality stuff to a 
minimum. One of these tools is the chat network that spans the Stack Exchange sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chat rooms, a convention has arisen to tag a message as &lt;kbd class="light"&gt;cv-pls&lt;/kbd&gt; for questions that need to be closed for one reason 
or another. Over time, this evolved to include other tags such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;del-pls&lt;/kbd&gt; for a deletion request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;spam&lt;/kbd&gt; for notification that spam made it through the already &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/228043/"&gt;impressive&lt;/a&gt; spam &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/237882/186281"&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;reopen&lt;/kbd&gt; for a reopen request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few others to cover specific flag types (eg. Not an answer, Very Low Quality or Offensive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introducing-zephyr"&gt;Introducing Zephyr&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-zephyr" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these is that the requests are only seen by users active in the specific room where it was posted. 
Other users across the network miss the request. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/SE_Zephyr_VoteRequest_bot"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was built to resolve this problem. Zephyr monitors
several rooms where these types of requests are frequent. These requests all all posted into a single &lt;a href="http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/773/low-quality-posts-hq"&gt;chat room&lt;/a&gt;. 
This provides users with a single room to monitor to see requests for multiple questions and sites across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of what Zephyr's chat activity looks like during a spam wave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zephyr's chat activity during a spam wave" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/zephyr-spam-wave.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr utilizes the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange"&gt;ChatExchange&lt;/a&gt; package to join and read the chat rooms. To do this, Zephyr required a dedicated
account. I decided to run Zephyr with a dedicated account to completely separate the bot that would sit and watch multiple chat
rooms 24/7 from my account. Zephyr maintains a small SQLite database of all the posts that it records. The idea behind this, 
is that eventually this data will be utilized to train other systems on unwanted content. This information is pulled via
the &lt;a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr watches the chat rooms for specific string &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/SE_Zephyr_VoteRequest_bot/blob/master/create_config_files.py"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;. If these patterns are matched, a message is posted if &lt;code&gt;should_post&lt;/code&gt; 
is &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; for the matched pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a nice simple application. It performs some pattern matching and a couple API calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-bots"&gt;Other bots&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#other-bots" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to watching user activity, Zephyr also watches two other quality bots that patrol Stack Exchange for low
quality content: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ArcticEcho/Phamhilator/wiki"&gt;Phamhilator&lt;/a&gt;. If either of these bots detect spam, Zephyr takes note of the information by
recording it to the database, but not reposting. Since both of those bots post their reports, it didn't make sense for Zephyr
to add a second (or third, if both of the others detected spam) message to the chat room. The information is recorded, though,
to help future training for other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="updates"&gt;Updates&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updates" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 8, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time Zephyr has been updated to include new rooms to monitor or new patterns to match. Those changes are small (and simple).
There are, however, a few larger changes that I'd like to note below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="commands"&gt;Commands&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#commands" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other bots that Zephyr monitors respond to user input. Zephyr has very little that requires user interaction since all of it's
posts are generated &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; user input. However, there have been times where I, as the bot owner, would like to be able to issue
certain commands to it. My most common desire is to see a report of how many spam posts Zephyr has seen. Thus, Zephyr now responds
to the command &lt;code&gt;spamreport&lt;/code&gt; from me. It then prints out a nice summary of information. This information has been utilized in 
SmokeDetector to watch for commonly spammed domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zephyr spam report for April 2015" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/zephyr-spam-report.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upgrade-from-sqlite-to-mariadb"&gt;Upgrade from SQLite to MariaDB&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#upgrade-from-sqlite-to-mariadb" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr was originally built against an SQLite database. This worked, but was getting slower as more data was being added. This slow down
was beginning to affect performance. I started seeing this error more and more frequently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "H:\python-virtualenvs\zephyr-se-voterequests\lib\site-packages\sqlalchemy\pool.py", line 255, in _close_connection
    self._dialect.do_close(connection)

ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread.The object was created in thread id 4824 and this is thread id 4660
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a lot of time troubleshooting and not resolving it to my satisfaction, I decided to upgrade to a more robust database. I'd used
MySQL/MariaDB before and I happened to have another application utilizing MariaDB at the moment so that is the solution I picked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was transferring data. I learned that there isn't a decent utility to do a straight migration. So, I took these steps to transfer the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export table structures and data from SQLite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the SQLite dump to MySQL format. Though both systems use SQL, there are slight differences in dialect. I utilized
 &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1067365/189134"&gt;this Python script&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point. It got me most of the way there, but not completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data clean up. Ugh. The dreaded part of the job for anyone who handles data. Fortunately, the script above did most of the work.
 I ended up fixing a couple stray back ticks that didn't convert properly, escaping a very extra quotation marks, and replacing
 a few "smart quotes" (of both the &lt;a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/201c/index.htm"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/201d/index.htm"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; variety). I wish data at the office job was this easy to clean...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import into MariaDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the transfer to MariaDB, I've noticed no performance degradation. The error about threads has been eliminated as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upgrade-to-utilize-web-sockets"&gt;Upgrade to utilize web sockets&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#upgrade-to-utilize-web-sockets" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Zephyr used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/blob/master/chatexchange/rooms.py#L68"&gt;&lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method when monitoring a room. This method would long poll the room. It turns out that this is 
pretty unreliable. I'd get multiple errors through out the week, ranging from &lt;code&gt;Connection Aborted&lt;/code&gt; errors to random &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; messages. The 
solution has been to switch to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/blob/master/chatexchange/rooms.py#L78"&gt;&lt;code&gt;watch_socket&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The only time I've had problems since this switch is when the Stack Exchange 
web sockets go down. This saves a lot of restarts to get everything up and running again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Thanks for all the fish</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-08T15:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-04-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-01-08:/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good bye, Team Vipers, it's been a great 6 years&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="goodbye-team-vipers"&gt;Goodbye Team Vipers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#goodbye-team-vipers" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Team Vipers shut down. Exactly 6 years after I join the community and 5 years after taking 
over as owner, I decided to step aside. I announced my decision to my admin team in November and asked if anyone wanted to 
take over. A week later I made the announcement public. I copied that below. My hope was that someone would be willing to 
take over day to day operations and management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one was able to take on the responsibilities. I had to make the hard choice of shutting down the community. 
I am unable to provide the time or monetary commitment this community requires any longer. Team Vipers was a home and 
community for 6 years. I've met a lot of people playing games with members of the community. Several other sites were 
created by members of Team Vipers. They have indicated they'd be willing to absorb and welcome members from Vipers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a great run. So long Vipers, and thanks for all the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="original-announcement"&gt;Original Announcement&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#original-announcement" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 5th, 2015, I am stepping away from Vipers as the owner and administrator. Unfortunately, I no longer have time 
to maintain the servers in a way that benefits the community. I announced this to the admin team earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-do-we-do-before-january-5th"&gt;What do we do before January 5th?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-we-do-before-january-5th" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am giving you this heads up to discuss the future of Vipers. If someone wants to step up and take everything on, I'll 
gladly offer help during the transition. If you have questions about what happens behind the scenes, I'll answer those 
as well. In fact, I'll start with a few questions that I think may help lead this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-multiple-game-servers"&gt;Do we need multiple game servers?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#do-we-need-multiple-game-servers" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer - No. If the community wants to focus on a specific server mode, then a single server is all that is needed. 
When I joined Vipers there were two servers: An Orange server and a vanilla server. For the first year-ish, the 
servers base grew and contracted around different mods. Orange turned to Crit Orange, a Randomizer appeared and then 
splintered into it's own community, the Nest grew and then shrank. Zombie popped up. Prophunt and Dodgeball came around 
multiple times. In all of this, there has been between one or two popular servers, with the rest being very niche. Those 
are for fun. Those are also frustrating to fix when updates break them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-a-dedicated-server"&gt;Do we need a dedicated server?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#do-we-need-a-dedicated-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, no. The benefit the dedicated server provided is IP address stability. Before the dedicated server, the game servers 
jumped around IPs every few months. With each move players were lost. Some found us months or years later when they
randomly stumbled upon us. Others are just gone. More importantly though, is dealing with performance. If there is a 
hosting company that can provide high quality, low ping, servers at a cheap price - that is worth it. A word of advice, 
avoid EscapedTurkey. It is a one man operation and that person doesn't know what they are doing. If an issue crops up, 
it takes hours to days to resolve it. It is because of them that we purchased a dedicated server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note. I can not transfer the dedicated server to anyone. It's rented in my name and the hosting company doesn't 
allow transfers. So, no matter what happens, the IP addresses would have to change anyway. The upside of this long 
transition period is that you have plenty of time to advertise and set up the new servers. We could have in game announcements 
AND we can lock the existing servers with the new IP in the titles. It won't be an immediate cut over. It provides 
notification to the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-the-forums"&gt;Do we need the forums?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#do-we-need-the-forums" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The forums are what kept me in Vipers before I ended up in the position I'm in now. Without the forums, there is no 
community. There are people that you see frequently on the servers, but rarely any meaningful interaction. With the forums 
we get stories of our members' lives. If, however, you are going to stick to playing Valve games, I highly recommend a 
change in forum software. Find something that supports integration with Steam (either natively or via plugin) and start 
over. With that integration, you can do so many more (and non-hackish) things. You can pull information from Steam or 
any other TF2 community that exposes an API. Banning a player on the servers and the forums is easy as both are based 
on the same thing. Additionally, requiring the Steam login should eliminate the spam (no random Chinese, Russian, 
Californian spam bots). In any case, I will provide a full database dump for you. If you stick with PHPBB, I think a 
fresh install of PHPBB would be a good thing, but you'll have all of the data and should be able to simply import it 
into the database. If you go with something else, you'll have the database and can attempt to use that software's 
conversion script. Results will vary on how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="does-we-make-money-on-donations"&gt;Does we make money on donations?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#does-we-make-money-on-donations" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Since July of [2014 to November 2014], the community has donated $20. Total. It has been 14 months since we reached our monthly 
goal. In the last year, we have broken $50 only 4 times. To prevent someone from misconstruing this as a plea for 
money, I've disabled donations. I don't want someone to start a misguided "Save the Vipers" campaign that you believe 
can succeed with donations. The way to "save the vipers" is to come together as a team and discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-happens-if-no-one-steps-up"&gt;What happens if no one steps up?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-if-no-one-steps-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone in the community may step up, but if no one steps up by January, then Vipers has one last New Years hoo-rah 
and fades to the internet. If someone does step up, I am still available to help with initial set up. I'm still available 
to play games and to talk to. I'm not dropping off the face of the earth and I'm not rage quitting. This is very 
much a case of real life happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is going to cover your initial questions. If you have more, post them here and I'll answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has been a great 6 years with everyone here. While I may be stepping down as owner, if someone keeps Vipers around, 
you'll keep me around as a regular. I've had fun talking to all of you and playing with (and against) all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="updated-steam-group-ownership"&gt;Updated Steam Group Ownership&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updated-steam-group-ownership" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 28, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership of the Steam Group for Team Vipers has been transferred back to Russell, the original founder of Vipers. The 
&lt;a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viperservers#announcements/detail/205255298394906049"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; was posted to the group earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also transfered data from the Vipers blog to my personal one here and removed links to Vipers from most posts 
since they will all fail to resolve correctly. Unfortunately, it's not worth it to preserve small bits of history in 
this case and was just easier to remove the links. The best I can do it transfer the blog posts and copy snippets or

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was originally &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on December 14, 2014. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Yes it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 27, 2014 Skynet awoke. It looked at Stack Overflow and thought "Why are all these people being so chatty and talking about obsolete things? I should nuke them all!" Fortunately, Skynet was a baby and only had access to my 100 comment flags a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this activation date, the system was fed with 10,000 "Good Comments", "Obsolete" comments and "Too Chatty" comments. These comments were taken from the &lt;a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Stack Exchange Data Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. The "Obsolete" and "Too Chatty" comment types had to meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total comment length of less than 100 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment has a 0 score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had variations of the following phrases:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'%mark%answer%'
'%mark%accept%'
'%accept%answer%'
'%lease%accept%'
'%mark%answer%'
'%thank%you%'
'%thx%you%'
'%.....'
'+1%'
'-1%'
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good Comments" were assumed, initially, to be anything that didn't fall into the above criteria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provided a base of 30,000 comments that were roughly categorized into 3 distinct groups. Manually scanning the classifications took several weeks, and through this some of the groupings were changed to reflect a more appropriate classification. Not all comments less than 100 characters starting with "Thank you" are "too chatty", just as not all comments over 100 characters are good comments. I reclassified these comments as if I had encountered them on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step was to train a classifier. I had initially assumed that I'd start with a Naive Bayes to get a baseline and then work to something more complicated from there. Perhaps, extract text features, user information, etc. and build a fancy classifier. My initial tests showed that the Naive Bayes was accurate 80-90% of the time with test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I combined the classifier's certainty of classification with an acceptable threshold of when I'd allow a flag to be issued in my name. Tuning these threshold took a few weeks but eventually I determined the following thresholds were appropriate for my use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;Type            | Threshold     | Flagging Enabled&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
too chatty      | 0.9997        | True
obsolete        | 0.99          | True
good comment    | 0.9999        | False
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a comment is classified, if it exceeds the threshold for one of the above, it is recorded into my database for future retraining. If flagging is enabled, the API is &lt;a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/comment-flag-options"&gt;utilized&lt;/a&gt; to issue an &lt;a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/create-comment-flag"&gt;appropriate&lt;/a&gt; flag. Obviously, I don't want to flag good comments, but I do want to record them so that I can reuse the data in a later training step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have the results of this experiment been? From my point of view, I'd venture that it's been successful. I have automatically flagged over 17,000 comments. As of December 17, 2014, the process has been running for 173 days. My comment flagging stats are currently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;26885   comments flagged
26714   deemed helpful
171     declined
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started at (approximately):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;9885    comments flagged
9847    deemed helpful
38      declined
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives me an overall accuracy of 99.36%. Down from 99.61% when no automated process was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are pictures that help tell this story too. In this first one, we see that the rolling 10 day average for the number of declined flags has stayed below two flags a day. In October, there was a two week period where the rolling average was 0 and nearly a month long period where the system did not make any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/flags_per_day_rolling_average.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, the number of mistakes has climbed slightly. The biggest number of mistakes it has made was the opening day of Winter Bash 2014. Purely speculation, but I believe this was the moderators being protective of content and not wanting people to farm the &lt;a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/resolution"&gt;Resolution hat&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I don't know this. Another theory I have about this uptick since November is the adjustment to day light saving time. My process starts 10 minutes after UTC. It is possible that this earlier hour has caused my flags to be processed by a different moderator, or a moderator that is more awake/less hungry/in a different mood than previously at this point in the daily rotation cycle or because they &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/215397/186281"&gt;lost their keys&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Total flagged vs Total Declined" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/total_flags_vs_total_declined.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for 3 days, since June 27th, the process has flagged 100 comments a day. In this chart, you can see the number of declined comment flags along the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Number of comments saved per day" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/comments_saved_per_day.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this chart shows the number of comments that the system wanted to act on (and a rolling 5 day average). When the system was brought online, it was acting on 700-800 comments a day (saving to my local database). Many of these were being classified as "Good Comments". You can see the day that I adjusted the threshold for "Good Comments" to be acted upon (saved). The drop in the number of comments the system saved is dramatic. Instead of saving 700-800 comments daily, the system now averages about 150 comments to save. Since I don't flag "Good Comments", I feel this is the appropriate action to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 id="flagged-but-declined"&gt;Flagged but declined&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#flagged-but-declined" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, I've had comments flags declined. Some of these obviously should have been and required a retraining or threshold adjustment on my part. Others, in my opinion, should have been removed as noise. Below is a small sampling of both types of comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent comments that I feel are noise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27420526/i-want-to-play-from-frame-2-and-then-stop-at-frame-3/27425983#comment43388489_27425983"&gt;yes thank you so much for you help it works sorry for the late reply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27476522/how-to-call-a-function-by-a-pointer/27476639#comment43387801_27476639"&gt;Wow it works. Thank you very much!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27284958/why-thread-id-creates-not-in-order/27285031#comment43038003_27285031"&gt;wow that works!Thanks so much for your advice!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27375504/remove-legends-for-each-point-and-keep-only-those-which-are-outliers-for-ggplot/27380631#comment43387125_27380631"&gt;Ok, the works great, thank you so much!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14907518/modal-view-controllers-how-to-display-and-dismiss/14910469#comment43386201_14910469"&gt;Thank you very much for your explanation, you rock dude !!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some comments that were incorrectly flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18545905/meteor-without-mongo#comment42850716_18545905"&gt;@Spina: yes. Check my answer. You can simply point MONGO_URL to an invalid URL.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27007685/how-can-i-position-divs-at-the-bottom-of-container-div-and-inline/27007772#comment42544238_27007772"&gt;Sorry, my error. I was: "position", not "display". Check it: jsfiddle.net/hvfku99c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26745185/multiple-spacebar-conditional-operators/26745790#comment42078870_26745790"&gt;I believe UI.registerHelper is, being deprecated. Please check my updated answer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other comments are flagged but then edited prior to a moderator seeing the comment. The edit adds information to the post, thus the declination is justified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27406267/neo4j-very-slowly-using-shortestpath#comment43271781_27406267"&gt;Yes, I have indexes. Let me show my schema&lt;/a&gt; was edited to the much more useful: &lt;code&gt;Yes, I have indexes for UUID and Permission. In fact rlationship is a variable length here (e)-[rp:Has_Pocket|Has_Document*0..]-&amp;gt;d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26535662/how-to-read-files-in-sequence-from-a-directory-in-opencv/26536198#comment41709286_26536198"&gt;Here is the question i had posted first using FIleStorage issue&lt;/a&gt; was edited to include the link to the referenced post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that despite getting flags declined, some comments do eventually disappear. This is due to either flags raised by other community members putting the comment back in front of a moderator or by simply accumulating enough community flags for the system to act automatically. In either case, the desired result of removing noise has been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27006363/node-js-parse-filename-from-url/27006555#comment42544432_27006555"&gt;Oh, derr. good point. Edited.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27073761/redefining-the-hitbox-of-objects/27073838#comment42659999_27073838"&gt;You're right! Hopefully you see my point anyways.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lessons-and-observations"&gt;Lessons and Observations&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#lessons-and-observations" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication to other sites would depend on site culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a (fairly) non-subjective site, Stack Overflow made a good test case for this. On a site like &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://parenting.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Parenting&lt;/a&gt; or other site that accepts subjective answers, "too chatty" would be much harder to classify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/277314/189134"&gt;+/-1 has been discouraged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation I made on my own that comments with this type of content were distracting has been noticed by others as well. This was actually a very nice validation of my own process and some of the &lt;a href="https://stackedit.io/viewer#!provider=gist&amp;amp;gistId=af9d8186690cb658aafe&amp;amp;filename=commentblacklistresults.md"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; posted on that thread show many such comments continue to be noise. Of course, this change did also force users to modify their content and may have added new patterns that can be utilized in future training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/245416/186281"&gt;automatically check flags&lt;/a&gt; would be great so that automated runs could be paused if it goes crazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of checking that my flagging history remains accurate is time consuming. The status of a flag can't be acquired via the API. I've submitted a feature request for this information to be added to the API. With this information, flagging can be paused or stopped if X number of flags are declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Overflow's volume of comments is a crutch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the &lt;a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/200435#graph"&gt;high volume of comments&lt;/a&gt; and limited number of comment flags my account has available, I can afford to be picky on which comments I want to act on. The classifier itself is about 85% accurate in determining the type of comment. However, I artificially increase my accuracy by only acting on comments that have a very high classifier certainty by forcing this certainty level to meet or surpass my threshold values from above. Smaller sites, with a lower volume, don't have the benefit of having enough comments to be this picky. It is on these sites that a more feature based classifier would be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human element is still unpredictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classifier was trained utilizing my idea of how comments should be flagged. Prior to automating this, I was not 100% accurate. Additionally, moderators are not 100% accurate in their processing of flags. &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/278813/189134"&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280426/189134"&gt;disagree&lt;/a&gt; on how these rules should be implemented, but are willing to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/278927/189134"&gt;assist&lt;/a&gt; in keeping the site clean. With more than 175K comments a week, every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discussion"&gt;Discussion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my title states, my original question was whether or not I can teach a machine how to flag comments as I would. The answer to that is yes. The next question is whether this type of system would be helpful in cleaning up comments across Stack Overflow. My system works only on new comments created around each new UTC. Once my 100 flags are hit (or the API tells me to stop), it shuts down for the day. Having something automated go through historical comments or that can run all day would be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, now that I've admitted that I've been automatically flagging comments, can I continue to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;Update&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#update" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section has been updated multiple times since the original post. Most recently, it was updated May 3, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the introduction, this was originally published in December 2014. How is the system behaving now? It is performing very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="process-changes"&gt;Process Changes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#process-changes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2015, &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/283030/189134"&gt;another user&lt;/a&gt; was using a basic query to look for invalid comments. This caused a high number of moderator flags, many of which were declined. My process was caught in this mass decline. This resulted in 49 declined flags for a single day.
This is, by far, the largest number of declined flags the process has generated in a day. It did, however, prompt a process change after consultation with the Stack Overflow moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process will no longer flag comments newer than 48 hours old. This provides users with a two day window to see a comment before the system will flag it. This single change has provided a huge improvement in terms of flag acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="may-2015-11-months"&gt;May 2015 (11 Months)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#may-2015-11-months" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly a year of running, these are my flagging statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;39938   comments flagged
39659   deemed helpful
279     declined
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a helpful rate of 99.3%. This is down &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; slightly from 99.36% in December. I attribute a large part of the dip to the issue mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/latest_flags_per_day_rolling_average.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an updated chart showing the rolling 10 day average for number of declined flags. I've had several stretches of multi-week time frames with no declined flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a busy chart, so I've narrowed it down to show just the last 90 days. From here you can see that in the past 90 days there have been only 10 declined flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average - 90 day window" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/latest_flags_per_day_rolling_average_90day_window.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sept-2015-15-months"&gt;Sept 2015 (15 Months)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#sept-2015-15-months" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been almost 15 months since the process started. In that time, the model has gotten more accurate. Since the last update in May, I've had only 3 declined comment flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;52351   comments flagged
52069   deemed helpful
282     declined
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a helpful rate of 99.46%. Here is an updated chart showing the rolling 10 day average for number of declined flags. The 90 day window is not even worth showing. It has three days where a single flag was declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average - 15 Months of data training" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/declined_per_day_15_months.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary-of-2015"&gt;Summary of 2015&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-2015" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I processed comments 359 days out of the year. I missed three in January due to stopping it after a mass decline of flags (more later), I can't account for a missed day in July and August. I don't recall stopping it, but I missed July 3rd and August 19. I also missed December 28th due to a power issue. I flagged 35,960 comments. Of that, 111 were declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By month, this is the break down of rejected flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2015 Flag Summary" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/2015-flag-summary.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blip at the end of November is due to new moderators being elected and adjusting to what other moderators consider "good" versus "bad" comments. I didn't see the spike in the April election which is interesting, but after a couple days in November it's back to normal. The January spike I mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting note: The longest stretch in the year with no declined flags was from August 13th through November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="machine learning"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Moderation postion on Moderators</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/moderation-postion-on-moderators.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-02T10:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2014-07-02:/moderation-postion-on-moderators.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've thrown my hat into the ring for a moderation position on Stack Exchange's newest site: Moderators&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;I've been the owner of Vipers for almost 5 years. In that time I've help the community grown and get stronger. I've helped
members begin their own communities and I've maintained the game servers the players utilize 24 hours a day. I've been 
concerned about low activity, excited about new events and updates, and watched the community ebb and flow through out
the years. I've dealt with trolls, spammers, and new community members. I think I've gained valuable experience in 
managing a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also a member on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and over the years gotten to know others that enjoy the "Meta" aspect of 
Stack Exchange. That's the "behind the scenes", "how does this site work?" discussions and activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moderators"&gt;Moderators&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#moderators" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I found a way to merge my experience with Vipers and the knowledge of the Stack Exchange platform. A new 
community started recently: &lt;a href="http://moderators.stackexchange.com"&gt;Moderators&lt;/a&gt;. The idea behind this site is for people building, administering, managing or
cultivating digital communities to have a place to ask others with similar experiences questions. I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things a new site needs on the Stack Exchange network is a set of pro tempore moderators. While Stack Exchange 
believe in &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;community moderation&lt;/a&gt;, there are still some things that require more access. These pro tempore moderators
are those people. I &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/80/78"&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; myself for one such position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-nomination"&gt;The Nomination&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-nomination" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the nomination I presented to the community. In it, I discuss my experience with Vipers and some of our challenges.
One in particular that I mention is the &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html"&gt;automated language filter&lt;/a&gt; we have on the game servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an administrator/site owner of a medium sized gaming community that runs on a PHPBB3 board. We host multiple game 
servers as well. I've got a team of moderators that help keep the forum and game servers clean. I've run this site for 
5 years, after taking it over from the original creator of the community who wanted to move on. In my time as admin, 
we've seen the number of participants on the forum increase. We've seen our game server population increase as well. 
I attribute this to getting the community involved in change discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest changes occurred several years ago. Community members complained that our game servers would be over 
run with trolls at hours when moderators weren't available and spewing filth. The community wanted a cleaner game 
server experience. Users wanted these players gone immediately. Previous community leaders felt that trolling of this 
kind was part of the game and did nothing. After some discussions regarding what was and wasn't appropriate, we decided 
to be (for lack of a better term) "family friendlier". Certain 'extreme' phrases were no longer tolerated at all. A 
technical solution was built to automatically remove players that violated these rules. This solution allowed users to 
swear, but once it became excessive (again, defined by the community) they, too, were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool we have (PHPBB3) may not have the reputation, badges, or increasing privileges used here on Stack Exchange but 
for my community that has not been a negative. Engaging with the community in discussions and letting the members provide 
input that me and my team utilize has been extremely beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no experience moderating a Stack Exchange site. I don't feel that's a down side though. I can provide the 
"outside" perspective in a Stack Exchange heavy group. That does mean, though, that I'd depend on and expect the 
community to provide feedback on how moderation in being handled. Much like my existing gaming community, input from the 
community to the moderation team is important and the moderation team should be listening to that input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="appointment"&gt;Appointment&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#appointment" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on August 12, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/138/78"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; to a moderator position on Moderators. I now "moderator the moderators", as the running joke 
has been on meta and the chatroom. I am looking forward to helping this community grow and to providing my experience 
of community management outside of Stack Exchange to this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="renaming-to-community-building"&gt;Renaming to Community Building&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-to-community-building" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on December 4, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost since the beginning of Moderators, there have been conversations about whether the name is limiting our scope. We aren't
a community for &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; moderation questions. We are a community about how to build communities and moderation happens to
be a part of community building. (How many times can you say "community" before it sounds weird?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/140/78"&gt;Discussions&lt;/a&gt; began in August about possible name changes. These &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/175/78"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; continued into October as we worked on
the &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/172/78"&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt; of our site. Finally, on December 2, we received our new name: &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/193/78"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;. It's the same great site
but with a much more relevant name. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>How to appeal a ban effectively</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-to-appeal-a-ban-effectively.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-22T22:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-22T22:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2014-04-22:/how-to-appeal-a-ban-effectively.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on last week's post about improper ways to appeal, this post shows effective appeals and why they worked&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-not-to-appeal-a-ban.html"&gt;last week's post&lt;/a&gt;, I showed three ways that appealing bans on the Vipers forums would fail. Everyone makes mistakes
and we try to recognize that when someone comes to the forums and makes a good appeal. We usually offer an unadvertised 
"last chance". This is the chance to prove you've changed. If you fail, you are gone for good. If, however, you have changed
behaviors, this allows you to play on the Vipers servers again. To get this chance though, you have to make an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="super-secret-formula-for-getting-unbanned"&gt;Super secret formula for getting unbanned&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#super-secret-formula-for-getting-unbanned" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to a successful appeal is to do all of the following in your appeal thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post in complete sentences, using mostly correct english. I'm not going to mark you off for simple spelling mistakes, but
 I'm not going to read your post if it looks like you typed it from your phone to your teenage buddy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay polite. If you lose your cool, it's much less likely we are going to want to work with you. Remember, this is a game.
 You not being able to play on one server is not the end of the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why you think your ban was inappropriate. Make this short and to the point. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't lie. I have logs. I know how to read logs. I even have ways of quickly searching through the logs for specific
 times, if you provide that information. If your story doesn't match what I see in the logs, I'm not going to engage with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer questions from the admins. It's entirely possible you didn't provide a crucial bit of information or we need to 
 wait for input from the banning admin. In either case, if an administrator asks you a question, you should probably answer
 it. When you do so, follow the first two bullet points above. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is most of the appeals fail at step 1. These posts are to facilitate communication between the admin team
and the player that wants to return to the server. In these appeals I try to educate a player on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they were banned 
in the first place. If it's difficult to understand what is being said, it's very hard to have this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="team vipers"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>How NOT to appeal a ban</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/how-not-to-appeal-a-ban.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-14T22:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-14T22:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2014-04-14:/how-not-to-appeal-a-ban.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm reasonable.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running Vipers for about four and a half years. In that time I've seen my share of players get banned. The "good"
ones realize they screwed up and come back when the ban has expired and never have an issue again. These types of players
are common if they are first time offenders. The minute someone gets a second ban, the likelihood of them getting another
ban shoots way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-rules"&gt;Our Rules&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#our-rules" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vipers has five very simple rules. These are presented every time someone joins any of our game servers. They have to 
click "Continue" to move past them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Vipers Rules" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-rules.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a very simple structure for how bans work. Unless you are incredibly egregious in your behavior, or are out right
cheating by using hacks of some kind, you get a 4 strike policy. The ban length for the first three increases for each, but you
are allowed back. On the forth, we show you the door. Most of our bans are &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html"&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt;, thus are violating the very first rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bad-appeals"&gt;Bad appeals&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#bad-appeals" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing on our servers is not a right. It is not a guarantee. We are not obligated to provide a gaming environment for you
to spew your filth. If you can't meet our simple rules, you can leave. If you want to get back into the servers after your
forth offense, you have to come to us and ask. You should think about how you get someone to do what you want in "the
 real world". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-1-freedom-of-speech"&gt;Method 1: Freedom of Speech&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-1-freedom-of-speech" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this one is my favorite. Last I checked, I'm not the government of the United States. I'm a private citizen providing
a private server for others to play on. My server, my rules (technically, the community's rules, but you understand...) 
I am not bound by the First Amendment to allow you to say whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Freedom of speech appeal" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-speech-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break down some of the flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, and most importantly, we do not have a member named "DarkWolf", let alone an admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DarkWolf was banned, automatically, 2 minutes prior to the person making this appeal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chat logs show that the person appealing even noticed the ban and made a comment. It was this comment that
 triggered the ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seen in this image is the response when this was pointed out and the appeal denied. The response managed to hit all
of the trigger words we ban for on the servers. Just in case we were reconsidering the denial, at this point we're not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-2-admin-abuse"&gt;Method 2: Admin Abuse&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-2-admin-abuse" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admins are evil and are holding a grudge! They hate me and ban for inappropriate language. Honest, I never said anything bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing how quickly that tune changes when I can produce exact, timestamped, logs with their Steam ID attached to it. It's even 
more amusing when the admin being accused is "Zephyr", the automated process that watches for such language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Admin abuse appeal" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-abuse-appeal-1.png"/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break down this one too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zephyr is a bot. It is not holding a grudge and it is not stalking you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swearing, unless very very excessive, isn't going to trigger a ban&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat logs show this is the 4th automated ban. In each ban, the user has managed to slip in multiple offensive phrases
 befor being automatically kicked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-3-ranting"&gt;Method 3: Ranting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-3-ranting" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rant isn't helpful to anyone. It doesn't endear the poster to the community. The administrators don't want to read through
a rambling, unformated, exposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rant appeal" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-rant-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several logic errors and contradictions to their own arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't actually mention they are looking to be unbanned, just that they want to complain about the rules. (It's mentioned
 in a later post that they'd like to be unbanned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat logs clearly indicate the player was fond of certain slurs. This is the reason for the bans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-4-threats-to-the-server"&gt;Method 4: Threats to the server&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-4-threats-to-the-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats to attack the server in some way are not going to get you unbanned. There are only two possible outcomes to this
appeal type. Either you are successful and the server is off line (now how are you going to play even if unbanned) or we
ignore your tantrum and leave you banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DDOS appeal" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-ddos-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no reason to unban you. You've threatened the servers and made an ultimatum that effectively holds us hostage: 
 "Either I get to play with you, or I'll take down your servers". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You offer no proof of your claims (unsurprisingly, none existed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above I've posted three of the most common methods people use to appeal their ban on the Viper servers. Every time one of
these types of appeals is posted, it is rejected and the player is told they aren't welcome. All I (and the community) ask
is a little bit of respect. You've already proven that you can't follow our rules if we reach this point. If you have truly 
changed, why don't you demonstrate some of that change while requesting the ban be removed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="team vipers"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>Mann Vs Vipers Beaten!</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/mann-vs-vipers-beaten.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-05T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-05T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2013-12-05:/mann-vs-vipers-beaten.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took months and endless hours of trying, but it's been done. Wave 9 has been beaten.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Team Vipers' Mann Vs Machine modification - Mann Vs Vipers - that was completed in August has finally been beaten. 
Last night a starving group of players finally put down Wave 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The players were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MooMooCow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CutieVamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starfox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy Cyanide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zhiv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team struggled against the Admin bots - InsaneMosquito, Venom and SchooledYa. I've been told we are terrifying to play
against and making us MvM bots with even higher stats made it even more terrifying. (I approve.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of Wave 9 from the victory. The winning strategy appears to be the one that works against us most of the time. 
Separate the medic (me), from the Heavy (Venom) and the Soldier (SchooledYa). Together, we're hard to stop, but apart we
can each be picked on for a while until there is no health left. The bots must have learned that weakness as well (I don't approve.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the winners!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11, 2013, Valve released a &lt;a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=11105"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; to Team Fortress 2 to limit idling. Idling is the process of launching
Team Fortress and then letting it run for a few hours and collecting item drops. It used to be simple to do by utilizing
the &lt;code&gt;-textmode&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_Line_Options#Command-line_parameters_2"&gt;game parameter&lt;/a&gt;. This would "launch" the game without graphics. From there, you just let it run and 
come back in a few hours with 8-10 new items (your weekly limit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this was to then trade or craft these into metal. The metal could be used to trade for keys, hats, etc. and
all you to be "rich". The quotes are there because I do realize that being rich in a virtual game does not make one rich in
the real world. But, since the &lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann-Conomy_Update"&gt;Mann-Conomy Update&lt;/a&gt; introduced this massive meta game to Team Fortress, I've tried to stay
out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed. I didn't just idle one account. I idled 17 accounts. That is between 136 and 170 items a week. That's between 68 to 85
scrap metal a week. That's between 7.55 and 9.44 refined metal a week. That is between 3 and 4 keys a week (depending on 
who I trade with). Keys are the backbone of the economy. Get enough of those and you can trade for anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't know what my goal was. I wasn't interested in the fancy hats (ooooh...shiny pixels). I didn't open crates
with the keys. I did utilize the keys to get &lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tour_of_Duty_Ticket"&gt;Tour of Duty&lt;/a&gt; tickets for me and some friends. That's honorable, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-this-happen"&gt;How did this happen?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-did-this-happen" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html"&gt;the bot I built for Vipers to handle the raffles&lt;/a&gt;. I realized that I could automate much more
than trading with players. I could automate trading between bots. I could automate &lt;em&gt;crafting&lt;/em&gt; - which is relatively time
consuming, especially when you have 136 items to go through. I could automate trading with established scrap bank bots. These
bots will take any two weapon drops and give you one scrap, even if the two items can't be crafted together. The idea is
that they get enough weapons that eventually they'll be able to craft it down to metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-set-up"&gt;The set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To idle 17 accounts I needed to figure out what my computer could handle. I had to figure out how to run multiple instances
of Steam and Team Fortress at a time. Enter an application I'd utilized before: &lt;a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/"&gt;Sandboxie&lt;/a&gt;. This application provides 
isolated sandboxes for applications to run in. Normally Steam won't run more than once on a machine. But, if you launch
it via Sandboxie, the host OS (and other Sandboxie environments) can't see that Steam is running in another instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of experiementation showed that I could handle 6 accounts idling at a time and have the computer remain just barely 
usable. I created new accounts and split them into which day of the week they'd be run. I had three days out of the week 
designated for idling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A batch script was built to launch the Sandboxie environments of the day that was to idle. Then it'd launch Team Fortress
in each of those environments. Then I'd go to bed. When I woke up the next morning, I'd shut down the environments. I'd 
repeat this for two more nights. At the end of the third night, I had all the items I could get for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts could not be free accounts. This meant that I needed to either buy an item for each account, or trade for an 
&lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Upgrade_to_Premium_Gift"&gt;"Upgrade to Premium Gift"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="getting-items-to-a-single-account"&gt;Getting items to a single account&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-items-to-a-single-account" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the process was to convert all the items to metal. Normally, this would take place by either logging into
each account and crafting there and then trading everything to a master account, or trading everything first then crafting. 
In either case, 17 accounts is a lot to handle and trading/crafting is rather boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to modify the raffle bot. I'd designate one account as a master account. This would be the account that
received items. All others would dump items to it. I'd log into the account that was receiving items and initiate a trade
with each other bot in turn. I'd issue a command &lt;code&gt;add all&lt;/code&gt; and that bot would dump it's inventory into trade. Making it
through all the bots would take 5 minutes. Previously it would take me an hour or more to log into each account and
manually add items to the trade windows and then confirm the trade on both sides. &lt;em&gt;yawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="crafting"&gt;Crafting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#crafting" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was crafting items to metal. The rule was that any two weapons utilized by the same class could be
crafted to scrap metal. That sounds simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of trial and error, I'd built a set of commands that would select compatable weapons and craft them together. This
particular aspect wasn't documented by Steam (or the revese engineered SteamKit2 library I was utilizing). Crafting would 
take about 15 seconds to get all compatible items to scrap and then combining 9 scrap to get a refined metal. This saved 
inventory space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the simple command &lt;code&gt;craftall&lt;/code&gt;, all those new weapons would be crafted into metal and then combined into refined metal. This 
would be done in less than a minute. Previously, I'd have to initiate each crafting session, add all items per craft, wait for the
craft to complete and then repeat. This was another 15-30 minutes saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="left-overs"&gt;Left overs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#left-overs" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crafting, there would still be left over weapons. There were weapons that had run out of same class items to craft
with. The solution was to trade these away in groups of two to &lt;a href="http://scrapbank.me/"&gt;ScrapBank.me&lt;/a&gt; and get scrap metal back. This could be
further combined to refined metal again wasting space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="metal-to-keys"&gt;Metal to Keys&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#metal-to-keys" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, human intervention was required again. I had to convert my metal to keys. I did this via trading. The easy
way to do this was to find someone running a keybot, that would take metal for a key. Many exist, but all of them overcharge.
The other option was to look for a trader that was getting rid of a bulk set of keys and then trade them. In either case,
I'd end the week with 3-4 keys. I'd trade these for Tour of Duty tickets and go play a game with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual work required on my part was starting the idling for the night, shutting down idling in the morning, starting
the automated trade, crafting and trade left overs processes and finally trading metal for keys. What used to take me hours 
to do each week, I could not do in less than an hour (the bulk of which ended up being trading metal for keys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-changed"&gt;What changed?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-changed" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve released a patch to limit how effective idling was. Their "Mann-Conomy" was seeing rapid inflation. The price of 
keys (which they sold for physical money) in metal was rapidly increasing. From the time I started this to the time I ended
it, it jumped from 2-3 refined per key to 9-10 per key, with no sign of stopping. Casual players were complaining they couldn't
get enough items to trade for this stuff. The patch also required that you click to confirm each new received item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="im-ok-honest"&gt;I'm ok. Honest.&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#im-ok-honest" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried for a few days to find an effective work around. I didn't. When I wasn't able to find one, I transfered all items 
to the master account and went through the process of converting to keys. With that, I purchased the final set of 
Tour of Duty tickets. The idle bots were shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a month now. The bots are still down. I'm still around. Looking back on this, I'm happy Valve broke this. It wasn't
doing anything for me other than providing me with something to do: "Need to idle tonight", "Need to craft and trade today", etc. 
Now I have that time back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased with the technical challeges I over came to get this done though. Crafting was the biggest, but I think I'm
most proud of the automated transfer of items to the master. Since the bots had to communicate via Steam and not via
a local application, working out how I was going to do that took some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, my friends, was my addiction to the meta game of a hat similator in a first person shooter. I'm over it now and 
looking forward to some other project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="automation"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="gaming"></category></entry><entry><title>Give some refined, Win some prizes</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-25T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2013-02-25:/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new raffle bot is introduced to the community&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, Vipers is supported by donations from the community. When the community doesn't cover the cost, I end up
covering the difference. This isn't my favorite thing to do in the world, but we've been pretty successful in the past. 
In recent months, though, we've been coming up short more frequently. This has motivated me (and the rest of the admin
team to find ways to cover costs). Now we have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-the-new-raffle-bot"&gt;Welcome to the new raffle bot&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-the-new-raffle-bot" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've built a Raffle bot based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot"&gt;SteamBot&lt;/a&gt;, which is the base of &lt;a href="https://scrap.tf/"&gt;scrap.tf&lt;/a&gt;. Entries to raffles will be one entry 
per refined metal. You can have an unlimited number of entries. I will convert the refined metal to various prizes 
(with the goal being keys most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we'll have the system select a set of winners from the entries. A user can only win once per raffle, so even if you you
have a gigantic number of entries, your odds of winning more than one position are zero. Only one win per steam id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the prices from &lt;a href="http://backpack.tf/"&gt;backpack.tf&lt;/a&gt;, the bot will determine the "value" of the items within the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-off-set-costs"&gt;How does this off set costs?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-this-off-set-costs" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items that are received that are of high value or any additional keys we can get based on raffle entries will be sold on 
various TF2 trading markets. The profits from these trades will be used to cover some community costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keep-high-value-items-for-future-raffles"&gt;Keep high value items for future raffles?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#keep-high-value-items-for-future-raffles" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This question was added based on feed back from the community. It was added on March 20, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to sell any such items. However, due to community feedback, I've changed my mind. We will utilize 
"high value" items as prizes for future raffles. These future raffles will not be announced until any running raffles are 
complete. It is also possible that such a raffle will run separately from the planned monthly ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-first-winners"&gt;Our first winners&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#our-first-winners" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on April 3, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first raffle completed at Midnight on April 1st. I was surprised by the number of entries we received. I'm even more 
surprised that the second one has begun and is already three quarters of the way to the number of entries it took a month
to receive. People want those keys, and I saw mention of those Bill's Hats too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of entries we received allowed us to completely cover the community costs that donations didn't cover. Thank
you to all our players that entered!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first winners are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cashprizes: Winner of 10 keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popinfresh: Winner of 7 keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iamthebaron: Winner of 4 refined metal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Guy From That Thing: Winner of 1 refined metal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stupid-soldier-spam"&gt;Stupid soldier spam&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#stupid-soldier-spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal of the crit server is fast game play, overpowered shots, and nearly instant death if you aren't paying attention.
The down side is the soldier spam. Lots of it. It's not unusual to have a team of soldiers spamming rockets. This is part
of the reason we stuck a class limit on Soldiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyro is a common way to counter a soldier firing at long range. The problem with pyro is that it has limited long range weapons 
in return. Unless you can sneak up on an enemy (not easy with spam and some of the maps), the pyro is stuck taking pot shots
with either the Flare gun or the shotgun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I added a plugin to the server that made Pyro much more effective at helping the team without needing to advance 
to the front line constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reflectiles"&gt;Reflectiles&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reflectiles" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflected Projectiles - Reflectiles, if you will - becoming homing projectiles when a Pyro air blasts them away. These
newly tracking projectiles will track an opposing team member and hunt them down. If the player being tracked dies before
the projectile hits them, the projectile will select a new target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that seems unfair. How do you defend against a homing projectile as a soldier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called &lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt; Fortress 2. You have team mates. Utilize them. That homing projectile can be reflected again by a Pyro
on your team. Each time a projectile is reflected it gets just a bit faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 20, 2015 with link to GitHub instead of the old SVN, my apologies for missing that link when migrating to this blog
It is important to note that this version hasn't been updated in a LONG time but was still functioning when Vipers shut
down. If it doesn't work, the first thing to try is updating SourceMod's gamedata. This was the fix every other time
it didn't work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is released on Github. &lt;/p&gt;

This post describes how I automated a large part of the process&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My admin tool of choice for the TF2 servers is &lt;a href="http://www.hlsw.org/"&gt;HLSW&lt;/a&gt;. It's decent at allowing me to manage a server without ever 
needing to log to the server. My biggest complaint about it is that I can only watch the game chat of one server at a time. 
Sometimes, it's helpful to see an ongoing conversation to resolve minor problems before they become big ones. For example, 
claims of "hacking" usually turn out to be completely baseless. But, if multiple users (and more importantly, multiple 
&lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; users) suddenly start mentioning a hacker, I can step in and resolve the problem without entering the server. 
HLSW is good for this. A hacker is confined to one server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is when there are reports of lag across all of the game servers. Vipers has a dedicated machine that 
runs 5 game servers. If all five suddenly report lag, there is a problem somewhere. With HLSW, though, I can't see all of 
the servers at once. Thus, I've built a tool...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chat-monitor"&gt;Chat Monitor&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#chat-monitor" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All chat that occurs on the servers is logged. I've used this to resolve complaints of unfair bans and reports of hackers. 
I built in a hook to these logs from the application template to quickly pull known aliases of users. It's been invaluable 
in solving problems of "what happened" on the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Multiserver Chat monitor" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-chat-monitor.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've expanded it's usefulness. Now I can load a single page and see all chat activity occurring on all active game servers 
on a single screen. It provides, at a glance, a quick way to see if there are problems on the servers. It also allows me 
to step back from picking which server I think will be "bad" and monitor that. Now I can monitor all of them at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inappropriate-words"&gt;Inappropriate words&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#inappropriate-words" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community, we've chosen to set a higher standard for our players. As such, we have a restriction on a total of 3 
words and a few derivatives of those words. This system is in place because the community stepped forward and wanted to 
clean up the experience on the servers a bit. The problem with these higher standards is that we don't have admins on the 
game servers (or watch chat logs) 24 hours a day. Thus, while admins sleep, a troll can wander through and spew garbage. 
Unless a user reports this behavior, we will never be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've built a system to handle this automatically. The system will monitor chat logs across all servers. If a user hits the 
threshold for banning, they will be removed from the server and banned for a day. The logic to the system is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="automated-removal-logic"&gt;Automated removal logic&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#automated-removal-logic" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inappropriate terms are configured with a "weight". This "weight" will be used to calculate whether or not a user 
 surpasses a threshold set for being banned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System monitors chat logs for configured terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a term is found, the offending message is saved. The term weight is added to the user's current threshold value. 
 If this is the user's first time saying one of these terms, they start at 0 and this weight is added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If user exceeds the threshold, the system issues a ban to Sourcebans. The user is then kicked from the game server. 
 The ban length will be 1 day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system keeps messages for a total of 5 minutes. If a message is older than that, the system forgets it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the three inappropriate terms all have a threshold of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. This means they saying the words results in a ban. 
Homophobic, racist remarks aren't welcome on the Viper servers. We can't prevent it, but we can deal with offences swiftly. 
The 5 minute window is added because the community requested that excessive swearing also be limited. We don't want to 
outright ban it, but they don't want a swear filled rant to occur after every match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I built in the 5 minute window and the thresholds. The system is configured to catch common swear words, but the words 
have a low weight. It'd take repeated spamming of the words in a 5 minute window to reach the threshold and be removed from 
the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="updated-removal-logic"&gt;Updated removal logic&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updated-removal-logic" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 17, 2012&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated system has been active for almost a month. I'm finding that the system has been removing the same set of 
players every other day. They aren't learning. This is despite the message they are shown when removed from the server. 
I've made a change to the logic in how long a ban will last. It provides a 4 strike system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First offence: Weight of term(s) said times 1. This means, for most cases, they are issued a single day ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second offence: Weight of term(s) said times 3. This means, for most cases, they are issued a three day ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third offence: Weight of terms said times 21. This means, for most cases, they are issued a three week ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forth offence: Permanent removal from the game servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has been very enthusiastic about how quickly users of inappropriate terms are removed. I've seen a few minor 
complaints about the permanent removal of users on the forth offence. I've told the community that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; a user protests the 
ban and &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they can show they've learned our rules, I will provide one additional chance after the user has waited a minimum 
of a month from from last time they were banned. If they return to their previous activities, they will be re-banned and 
they will not be able to return in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-at-shutdown"&gt;Update at shutdown&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#update-at-shutdown" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 20, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2015, Team Vipers &lt;a href="http://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt;. With that shutdown, all chat monitoring also shut down. The system was active 
from April 23, 2012 to January 4, 2015, for a total of 987 days. In that time, 4457 bans were issued for inappropriate 
language. That is over 4 users a day being removed from our player base because they couldn't maintain a respectful 
attitude. I consider that a success. I believe Viper community members did too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="team vipers"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Connect Python to OSI Soft PI</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/connect-python-to-osi-soft-pi.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-07T12:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-04-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2012-02-07:/connect-python-to-osi-soft-pi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How I connected Python to OSI Soft PI&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OSI PI is a historian database. I had a task to connect a python application to this database. I asked a question on 
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8898114/how-can-i-connect-python-2-6-to-osi-pi"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; about whether this was a simple problem to solve. After two weeks I still hadn't gotten a viable response,
so I had to build by own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did reach out to the vendor first for help. Their response back was not helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like pyodbc is written against ODBC 3.x.  The OSI PI ODBC driver is using ODBC 2.0.  The python ODBC driver manager 
will convert most ODBC 3 calls on the fly to ODBC 2 ones. Anything added to 3, however, will obviously fail. You would 
need to find some way to make sure that your only using 2.0 compliant ODBC calls.  Currently their is not a PI ODBC 
driver that is compliant with ODBC 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it looks like the vendor doesn't support Python (odd, they are named "PI", but I digress). Additionally, the drivers provided 
by the company initially didn't work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code below shows how I was able to finally connect python to OSI PI. It may not be the most elegant, but it 
functions for the purposes of my application. Initially I was attempting to connect using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc"&gt;pyodbc&lt;/a&gt; module. Unfortunately, 
OSI PI would return a message like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyodbc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IM002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;[IM002] [OSI][PI ODBC][PI]PI-API Error &amp;lt;pilg_getdefserverinfo&amp;gt; 0 (0) (SQLDriverConnectW); [01000] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The driver doesn&amp;#39;t support the version of ODBC behavior that the application requested (see SQLSetEnvAttr). (0)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They vendor mentioned that using OLEDB instead may prove more fruitful. Thus, the code below is how I got connected using 
the vendor provided OLDEB driver. The downside is that I also had to do this all through COM objects using &lt;a href="http://python.net/crew/skippy/win32/Downloads.html"&gt;win32com&lt;/a&gt;. 
I'm not knocking the module, because it is extremely useful and I've done some great things with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;win32com.client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;oConn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ADODB.Connection&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;oConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ConnectionString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Provider=PIOLEDB;Data Source=&amp;lt;server&amp;gt;;User ID=&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;;database=&amp;lt;database&amp;gt;;Password=&amp;lt;password&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;oConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;oConn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I followed up on my Stack Overflow post about 2 months after posting my solution with the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just following up on this after using it for a couple months. This is still the only way I've found to do this with 
python, but it seems to be very slow when I need to run a large number of queries. I suspect it is because I have to 
open/close the database connection for each query, but OSI PI/ADODB complains if I do not. Performance has not reached a 
point where I am forced to rewrite this yet. If/when I do I will follow up again. In the meantime others using this 
solution should be aware that it is slow when running many queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-old-rtd"&gt;The old RTD&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-old-rtd" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viper's own LinuxLover, aka &lt;a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=38829"&gt;pheadxdll&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/index.php"&gt;SourceMod forums&lt;/a&gt;, wrote the &lt;a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=666222"&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; of the Roll the Dice
plugin. It has provided countless hours of fun for players. After all, who doesn't love getting Toxic while standing near an enemy 
spawn and hearing the rage as they die immediately. It's usually worth the instant death that follows when the effect
wears off ten seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were problems though. The biggest was that the chances of getting a Good vs Bad roll were not equal. Instead, you 
had a roughly equal chance of getting any roll. There were 14 possible rolls. You had a 1 out of 14 chance of getting a specific
effect. However, 9 of those effects were negative. Thus, you had a much higher chance of getting a negative effect vs a 
positive one. The other major problem was that it was very difficult to add new effects. Finally, with the released mod
not being updated, and LinuxLover departing Vipers to handle his own community on the Randomizer server, it was next to
impossible to get changes made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt;: LinuxLover released a new version of RTD (the 0.4 branch) sometime after we had forked the version we had. The new
version on SourceMod contains many of the same features we have. It does not, however, contain all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-new-rtd"&gt;The new RTD&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-new-rtd" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic for how rolls are determined has been changed. There is now a list of Good Effects and a list of Bad Effects. When
someone rolls, the first thing that is done is determine whether or not we are going to have a Good or Bad effect. That is a 
50/50 chance. Then it randomly selects one of the effects that are active and appropriate for the player's current class
that falls under the winning category. This should even out the Good vs Bad complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change that I've added is that we can now more easily add effects. Some new effects have been added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerplay: When Uber isn't enough...you need Kritz and Uber. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze Bullets: You've been shot! You should run away, but you can't. You're frozen in place for the next ten seconds, if 
 you're lucky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Bullets: A bullet wound isn't enough. You need to be on fire too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No crits: Haha! You are on an all crits server and you just lost your crits. Go sit at the little kid table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valve Rockets: We've included something that may be slightly overkill. You tell me:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+9900% damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+9000% clip size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+75% firing speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+500 health on kill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 seconds of crits on kill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+200% speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+60% reload time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because sometimes overkill is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been testing performance of this over the last few months. Today is the day that everyone can get it without
   an admin being around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that haven't seen it, here is one of our first tests back in November&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OzHNr1Bz5QQ" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Headless Horseless Headmann: That's right, you can be the Halloween nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homing Projectiles: Is that soldier aimbotting?! Nope. His rockets are just following you where ever you go. Boom! Oh, 
 sniper arrows and pyro flares are probably something to avoid too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I added in the ability to log rolls to a database so that we can find fancy stats and ensure it's rolling fairly. I'll
update this post in a few months with some of our gathered stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="source-code"&gt;Source Code&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#source-code" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 20, 2015 with link to GitHub instead of the old SVN, my apologies for missing that link when migrating to this blog
It is important to note that this version hasn't been updated in a LONG time and all effects may not work any more. Specifically,
homing probably doesn't work because the Sidewinder extension had been broken by a Valve update in mid-2014. Other effects
should continue to work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is released on Github. It requires several common modules which are all available on the SourceMod forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository is: &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins"&gt;https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statistics"&gt;Statistics&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#statistics" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section was updated in January 2015 after the shutdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="good-vs-bad"&gt;Good vs Bad&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#good-vs-bad" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have exact stats on Good vs Bad rolls before the rewrite, but we started logging all rolls with the rewrite. This is the 
split of Good vs Bad. I am very happy with an almost exactly 50/50 split over nearly a million RTDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RTD Split" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/rtd-split.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="class-with-the-most-rtds"&gt;Class with the most RTDs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#class-with-the-most-rtds" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solider was the most popular class on the crit server. The images below show number of times our soldiers got certain rolls. Note that God Mode is 
low because the community decided having both God Mode and Powerplay was redundant. They decided to keep Power play. God Mode was
disabled about a year after this version was released. Homing is low because it wasn't implemented until about 18 months after
the initial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RTD Soldier" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/rtd-soldier.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="class-with-the-least-rtds"&gt;Class with the least RTDs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#class-with-the-least-rtds" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medics rolled RTD the least number of times. This means sense for two reasons. First, they were not a common class on the crit server. When 
nearly everything is one hit, one kill, it's very hard to build uber. Second, when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; try to build Uber, ruining it with a 50/50
shot at getting a bad roll isn't good for the team. The low God Mode and Homing results are the same here as they were for the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-happened"&gt;What happened?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-happened" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the Christmas holiday, the Team Vipers forums were hit by "multiple" users who decided it was a good idea to use our community 
as a battle ground. A Viper member stepped in to "help" resolve the problem by attempting to play mediator. (Notice the
air quotes. These are important later) The battling users turned on this member and escalated the matter to threats of violence. 
When the member stopped responding, the users got bored and began spamming the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a combination of it being Christmas and the admins doing Christmas-y things with their families, this went on for
hours. There were several rounds of clean ups, but the battle continued over nearly a 48 hour period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-troll-different"&gt;Why is this troll different?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-this-troll-different" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Christmas festivities had ended and I had time to sit down in front of a computer to investigate what happened, I began
piecing together a time line of events. It turns out that all of these "users" were coming from the same IP address.
On top of that, they shared the same IP address as the member that attempted to "help". Odd...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-little-more-background"&gt;A little more background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-little-more-background" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The member that was "helping" had recently been approached by the admin team in an effort to clarify some questions about
their age. One of the admins had been presented evidence that the user was under the age of 16, which we all know if the 
minimum age to be a Vipers member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user took this as a threat that we were going to remove them from the community entirely via bans on the servers and 
forums. They posted a rant on their "sub-community". To mean this seems much more like a place where people that didn't
like our rules go to complain about us in an unproductive manner. I'm still not sure why they set up this community in
the first place, because they have always expressed a very keen interest in Vipers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="follow-up-with-the-member"&gt;Follow up with the member&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#follow-up-with-the-member" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started seeing a pattern between the battling users and the member, I sent a Steam message to the member asking
if they were around so that we could chat. The conversation began with me asking about the rant they posted and whether
or not they were aware that we allowed players under 16 to play on the servers, but not be members. They said they were
not aware of this and seemed pleased they'd still be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked them for their attempt to help over the holiday. Then I mentioned that it was odd that all of the users were 
coming from the same IP address. It was agreed that was odd. When I said that there was another user that used that IP in 
the past, they stopped responding. A few hours later I got a message saying they were back and around to talk again but
they'd closed the Steam chat window and lost the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later they began complaining that their own forum had been spammed. I'll admit I was curious, so I went to
take a look. There were multiple "users" having a very similar battle across the other forum. The member had posted messages
as the voice of the community that it had to stop or they'd issue bans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sick of the game at this point. I mentioned that I knew they were all of the users involved. I'd issued bans to the 
user accounts on the forum. I revoked their Viper membership and banned their main account. I also made a note that they 
could appeal the ban in 6 months time. I figured they'd forget about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes a special kind of troll to spam their own site to try and convince someone you aren't a spammer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="after-effect-of-the-bans"&gt;After effect of the bans&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#after-effect-of-the-bans" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the member was less than pleased. There were vague threats made against me, the server, and anything they
could think of that would offend me. I simply ignored the user on Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn't sit well, apparently. The user attempted a denial of service attack on the game servers, which our hosting 
provider mitigated. Part of this mitigation involves sending me a list of IP addresses that were attempting to connect 
to the server at the time of the attack, and part of the traffic that automatically triggered their counter measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, there were only a few IP addresses. Geolocation says they are all in the same city. One of those IP addresses
is the IP of the user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-going-to-change"&gt;What is going to change?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-going-to-change" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I see out of all of this is that we didn't have active admins during the initial wave of spam. I can't fault
the admin team, after all it was Christmas. However, there have been a few requests recently for a couple more game server admins.
I feel this incident just confirms that we need a couple more. In the coming days, we'll announce who our new admins will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The member that has been removed has been banned from the servers and the forums. We've also destroyed two new user accounts
they created since the spam wave. This is business as usual. I did offer them the chance to appear at the end of June. 
I suspect they will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-appeal"&gt;The appeal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-appeal" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section was added on July 7th, 2011 after the user appealed their ban&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems I was wrong. They filed an appeal to their ban. Of course it took place over another holiday (4th of July). Fortunately,
our two European admins were still around while the rest of us were out enjoying some fireworks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal was filed on the forums, as is usual. Community members stepped in to experess their unhappiness that the user
would consider returning after what they did over Christmas. One of the admins that were around put a message in the admin
area and asked for feedback from other admins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned home after some amazing fireworks, I found I had an email from our hosting provider. They'd blocked another
attempted denial of service attack. I logged into the forums to see what was going on and noticed that the appeal thread
was not going well. The user were getting more and more upset at the community members who were rallying against their
return. It eventually ended with a note saying that they hope Vipers never recovers from the DDOS. At this point one of the
other admins locked the thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A check of the IP address the user was utilizing to post the messages and the list of IPs involved in the attempted DDOS
showed that the IP was on the list, and again they were all in the same city (and the same city as in December). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their appeal was rejected. They were informed they would not be welcome back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this appeal, I don't believe anything will need to change on our side. The appeal process concluded faster than normal.
Attempts to DDOS the community server makes the decision rather easy for the admins. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="team vipers"></category><category term="moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>Multiple IP addresses on the same physical network card</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/multiple-ip-addresses-on-the-same-physical-network-card.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-17T12:54:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-11-17T12:54:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2010-11-17:/multiple-ip-addresses-on-the-same-physical-network-card.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick walkthrough on how to configure a single network card to pull multiple IP addresses (RedHat based distribution)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are times when a server can be allocated more than one IP Address even though it contains only one physical 
network card. To associate these IP addresses with the server some manipulation of networking settings will need to be 
performed. The steps outlined in this walk-through are for RedHat based systems. This tutorial is for statically assigned 
IP Addresses (as a server generally will have).
For this walk through we are going to add one additional IP address to &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt;. Navigate to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;code&gt;ifcfg-eth0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ifcfg-eth0:0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0:0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we need to modify the new file slightly so that it gets it's own IP address. Open &lt;code&gt;ifcfg-eth0:0&lt;/code&gt; in your favorite editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;DEVICE=eth0:0           &amp;lt;-- Change this to match the new eth0:0 file we just created
BOOTPROTO=none
BROADCAST=x.x.x.x       &amp;lt;-- This is the broad cast address for the subnet the new IP is on
DNS1=x.x.x.x            &amp;lt;-- This is the main DNS server you are using (example: 64.120.14.26)
GATEWAY=x.x.x.x         &amp;lt;-- This is the gateway address for the subnet the new IP is on
HWADDR=&amp;lt;DO NOT CHANGE&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;-- Don&amp;#39;t change this from what is existing. The Hardware address is the same as the physical one
IPADDR=x.x.x.x          &amp;lt;-- This is your new IP address
NETMASK=x.x.x.x         &amp;lt;-- This is the netmask for the subnet the new IP is on
ONBOOT=yes              &amp;lt;-- Leave to yes
OPTIONS=layer2=1
TYPE=Ethernet
PREFIX=29
DEFROUTE=yes
NAME=&amp;quot;System eth0:0&amp;quot;    &amp;lt;-- Change to reflect new name of device
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Save your file with the new settings. Now we need to restart the networking service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;service network restart

When this happens, the following message will be displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;INVALID SQL: 145 : Table &amp;#39;{something}&amp;#39; is marked as crashed and should be repaired
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've found this error occurs when MySQL is unexpectedly shut down - whether from a power failure to the entire server or 
if MySQL itself has issues and you use the &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command to stop it. Unexpected shut downs, especially while these tables 
are being used, do not make MyISAM tables happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, you need the ability to stop MySQL in a controlled manner, and you need to know where the database files 
are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;locate *.MYI
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will return where all the MYI files are stored. In this example, I am using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/var/lib/mysql/mysql/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Go to the directory of the crashed table using the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command. Next, stop MySQL. This is to ensure the tables are not 
accessed while we perform our repair functions. If you don't perform this step, the repair may not succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;service mysqld stop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next we are going to perform two repair functions. The first one may take a while depending on the size of your tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;myisamchk -r --force --safe-recover *.MYI
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second repair step is used to ensure all table states are updated correctly and repair any minor indexing issues. It 
is likely that this step is not needed after performing the previous step, but it should only take a few seconds now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;myisamchk --force --fast --update-state *.MYI
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, restart MySQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;service mysqld start
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="technical"></category></entry><entry><title>Automated template for membership applications</title><link href="http://andrewwegner.com/automated-template-for-membership-applications.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-30T22:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-30T22:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2009-10-30:/automated-template-for-membership-applications.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How Team Vipers improved user applications and admin partipation in the process&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to long ago, applications for new membership in Team Vipers consisted of someone wandering onto the site, posting a 
few words and an administrator saying they were accepted as a member. This worked when we were a small community. We 
aren't small any more. We have 5 servers and hundreds of players a day. Each server has their own sub-community. There 
are players joining the forums than entire groups of people have never met because they play exclusively on one game server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admins were also inconsistent in how (or if) they voted. Some admins didn't realize they could have a say, thinking it 
was a privilege granted to only the senior administrators. We've built a system to resolve many of these problems and to 
make the administration side easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-new"&gt;What's new?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-new" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system presents all users with an application template. They fill out the form and the system handles the rest. 
The New Users and Applications subforum has been modified so that no one, except the bot, can create topics. They 
topics will only be created when the form is submitted. When a user applies to join Vipers, we will automatically 
include relevant information about the user as we know them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HLStats information: This helps us get a sense of where they play and how often they play. It will help admins identify 
 users they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; recognize based on the servers they frequent (because we all know certains servers are better than 
 others ;) &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; Vanilla Nest vs Crits &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ban information: This will check if the user has any recorded bans in &lt;a href="http://www.sourcebans.net/"&gt;Sourcebans&lt;/a&gt;. It's important to know if the 
 user has been banned previously. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Known aliases: Pulling information from our chat logs and Valve's profile page, we can build a list of known aliases. 
 This helps identify users that frequently change names but have been around a while. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be other features we add in the future as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 2012&lt;/em&gt; I've removed HLStats from the servers and removed it from new application information. We have 
added a check of a user's &lt;a href="http://steamrep.com/api.php"&gt;Steam Reputation&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a user applies, they are put into a two week hold. During this week it is expected they will stick around the forums 
and learn about the community they just applied to. Even better would be that they had done this before applying. While 
this two week hold is in place, the administration team will be able to cast they votes in a separate sub-forum. They can 
hold administration specific discussions - usually details that are important for admins to know, but don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be 
public. Once voting is complete, if they become a member, the system automatically grants appropriate forum and server 
related permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="voting-rules"&gt;Voting rules&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#voting-rules" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three admin "Yes" votes and zero "No" votes grants the user membership immediately after the two week window has expired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One or two "No" votes places a message on the user's application that the administrators are still considering the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three or more "No" votes rejects the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="possible-responses"&gt;Possible Responses&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#possible-responses" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="accepted-by-admin-team"&gt;Accepted by admin team&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#accepted-by-admin-team" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reach a total of three or more admin "Yes" votes, and do not get three or more admin "No" votes, you will be accepted 
as a member of Vipers and automatically have your forum access modified. You will receive a message similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Accepted" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/application-accepted.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="denied-by-admin-team"&gt;Denied by admin team&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#denied-by-admin-team" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reach three or more "No" votes your application will be denied. This will occur even if you receive more "Yes" votes
than "No" votes. Vipers is not a majority rule community. The decision has been made that if three admins do not feel comfortable
accepting your application, you will not be granted membership. You will receive a message similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Denied by Admins" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/application-denied.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="denied-due-to-lack-of-votes"&gt;Denied due to lack of votes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#denied-due-to-lack-of-votes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be accepted, your application requires a minimum of three "Yes" votes. If this can not be reached (and you also can't reach
 three "No" votes), your application will be rejected due to lack of votes from the admin team. This means that the admin team
 does not feel strongly either way about your application. Post on the forums. Play in the servers. Get to know our players
 and the community at large and then try again in a month. You will receive a message similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Denied with not enough votes" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/application-denied-not-enough-votes.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="denied-because-of-age"&gt;Denied because of age&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#denied-because-of-age" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat after me: "Age does not equal maturity." However, it has a very strong correlation. Over time we have learned that younger
 players tend to bring a lower maturity level that most of the community does not care for. As such, we've decided to set a minimium
 age requirement of 16. If a user indicates they are less than that, the system will reject their application with a message similar to
 this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Denied because of age" src="http://andrewwegner.com/images/application-denied-underage.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 2010&lt;/em&gt; This process has been in place for a few months now. It has gone very well. We've reduced the clutter 
in the applications forum. We've also seen the number of "forgotten" applications drop dramatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="original-announcement"&gt;Original Announcement&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#original-announcement" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original announcement is posted here for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr is an automated robot designed to improve our new member application process. The current process, which involves copying a template to a new thread and the potential for applications to become misplaced, is cumbersome and inefficient. The goal of Zephyr is to remove as much of the manual process as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, our new applicants will fill out an actual application online. The same information will be requested, but it will be in a more reliable format and will not require an applicant copy and paste anything between threads. This new application will be posted in the same forum as you're used to, and members will be freely able to comment and discuss the applicant via that thread. It will also display which date admin voting will be open, which is two full weeks after the original application post. This will hopefully cut down on any confusion related to the delay between application and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another note, from now on Zephyr will be the only user capable of creating new threads in the New Member Application forum. As previously stated, members will be able to post comments on existing threads, but the only new threads will come from the application process. This will keep the forum cleaner and help prevent applications from becoming lost or forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Zephyr is an automated robot. It is not programmed to respond to comments or questions. Doing so will not get your question answered. As always, if you have questions or comments about the application process, Zephyr, or anything else, you're welcome to send them to any admin. We'll be more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may all bow to your Robotic Overlord now.&lt;/p&gt;
