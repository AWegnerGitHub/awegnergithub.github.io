If you don't know how to log these, it can be difficult to troubleshoot such a crash. Let's walk through this gotcha and see how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well build application will use logging instead of &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements. An exceptionally well built one will log in such a way that additional context is added to each log message and be consumable by a log aggregation service. Perhaps I'll write up such an article in the future. For now though, let's focus on a single problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some sample code to demonstrate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FileHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"app.log"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(asctime)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(name)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(levelname)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(message)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setFormatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;addHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Application start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Application end"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, this sets up the &lt;code&gt;app.log&lt;/code&gt; file to receive our log messages. The &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function is going to divide two numbers, log the result, and end the program. Pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, in this case, it is dividing by zero. This throws an error and crashes the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console spits out a stack trace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/home/andy/main.py"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~~~~^^&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/home/andy/main.py"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~~~~~~^^^^^&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/home/andy/main.py"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~^~&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;division&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;app.log&lt;/code&gt; file contains a single line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;551&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__main__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gotcha"&gt;Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the gotcha here? The stack trace is right there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are, of course, right. However, imagine that this was not a simple application, but instead a production application that sends logs to a central service. Your application crashed and now one was watching the console. Your &lt;code&gt;app.log&lt;/code&gt; file has no information. It says the application started and then...nothing. What happened? Is it still running?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you dig through running processes, or check a &lt;code&gt;/health&lt;/code&gt; end point for responses, you find out that it isn't running. That took a lot of time, and production isn't responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've lost all visibility to what happened in your application at the most critical moment. When it crashed and spit out a stack trace, you want as much detail as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook"&gt;sys.excepthook&lt;/a&gt;. This is called when any exception is raised and uncaught, except for &lt;code&gt;SystemExit&lt;/code&gt;. It's pretty easy to utilize as well. A few small changes to the above code will allow us to log this completely unexpected &lt;code&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FileHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"app.log"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(asctime)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(name)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(levelname)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(message)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setFormatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;addHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;handle_uncaught_exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_traceback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;critical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"uncaught exception, application will terminate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_traceback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;excepthook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;handle_uncaught_exception&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Application start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Application end"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important bit is the new &lt;code&gt;handle_uncaught_exception&lt;/code&gt; function and the &lt;code&gt;sys.excepthook&lt;/code&gt; line (with appropriate &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statement). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;division&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great! Now when troubleshooting this failing application and looking at the logs, we can easily see that an exception occurred. Additionally, with proper updates to the logging, more context can be provide such as the values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. While it's easy enough to figure out that &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in this simple example, the context in a larger production application could save a ton of troubleshooting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging is vital to knowing what your application is doing. But, it's even more important to determining why it stopped working. If your logs aren't providing information when the application crashes, it's functionally useless. By implementing an &lt;code&gt;excepthook&lt;/code&gt;, you can catch and properly log uncaught exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of you are coming up with alternatives. Terrible ideas like wrapping the entire main block in a &lt;code&gt;try/except&lt;/code&gt;. There are legitimate reasons to throw an exception. In this case, a &lt;code&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/code&gt; is a great exception to catch. But, you'd want to do it around as small of a code block as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clean way to catch truly unexcepted exceptions, not something a developer could have anticipated and, perhaps, fixed with additional input validation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>How to fix GitLab 18 error regarding git_data_dirs</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab_18_git_data_dirs_resolution.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-07-06T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-07-06T08:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2025-07-06:/gitlab_18_git_data_dirs_resolution.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;GitLab 18 removes &lt;code&gt;git_data_dirs&lt;/code&gt; and if you have been using it and didn't notice the deprecation warnings, an update to GitLab 18 will fail. This is a simple fix.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html"&gt;set up GitLab in my home environment&lt;/a&gt;. I apprecate past me documenting the basic steps I took to do this, because I'll need them again at some point when I make upgrades to my home lab. I've documented somethings I've done (like &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/setting-up-gitlab-runners.html"&gt;setting up GitLab runners&lt;/a&gt;, or dealing with &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/disable-grafana-in-gitlab-16.html"&gt;Grafana being deprecated within GitLab&lt;/a&gt; or utilzing &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/obsidian-gitlab-setup.html"&gt;GitLab to automatically backup my Obsidian notes&lt;/a&gt;) Unfortunately, I didn't document everything. One of those things that I didn't document was changing where my repositories are stored on disk by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GitLab 17.8 (January 2025), a new deprecation warning started appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git_data_dirs has been deprecated since 17.8 and will be removed in 18.0. See https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#migrating-from-git_data_dirs for migration instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a little annoyed that there were only 5 months of notice on this because major versions are released in May. In any case, if you attempt to update to version 18 or beyond and are utilizing &lt;code&gt;git_data_dirs&lt;/code&gt;, the upgrade will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, GitLab is good at providing &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration/#migrating-from-git_data_dirs"&gt;documentation on resoluting and migrating&lt;/a&gt; through the deprecations. However, on my first attempt I encountered an error. I believe it's because I missed a note buried in the text - not the code blocks - the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;/repositories&lt;/code&gt; suffix must be appended to the path because it was previously appended internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to open &lt;code&gt;/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb&lt;/code&gt; (you probably should make a backup first). Find the &lt;code&gt;git_data_dirs&lt;/code&gt; line. For me this was around line 455. Then comment out this entire block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then find (or add) the &lt;code&gt;gitaly['configuration']&lt;/code&gt; block. This was immediately after the &lt;code&gt;git_data_dirs&lt;/code&gt; section for me. Uncomment it, and add the appropriate path (from your &lt;code&gt;git_data_dirs&lt;/code&gt; block) and add &lt;code&gt;/repositories&lt;/code&gt; to the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are done, run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;gitlab-ctl reconfigure
gitlab-ctl restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a minute to fire up all the GitLab subcomponents, and then you should be able to update GitLab beyond version 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="new-code-section"&gt;New code section&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#new-code-section" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;code&gt;gitlab.rb&lt;/code&gt; now has this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;git_data_dirs({
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;  "default" =&amp;gt; {
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;    "path" =&amp;gt; "/previous/path/to/repos"
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;   }
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;})

&lt;span class="gu"&gt;##&lt;/span&gt;# Gitaly settings
gitaly['configuration'] = {
storage: [
    {
    name: 'default',
    path: '/previous/path/to/repos/repositories',
    },
],
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this quick change, I can continue to hold the repositories at a location of my choosing. The biggest thing is to add &lt;code&gt;/repositories&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; in the new Gitly configuration. With this change, I can continue to utilizing the current version of GitLab - a tool that I still find invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="gitlab"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: Identity vs Equality - When 'is' Fails Unexpectedly</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-identity-vs-equality.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-06-17T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-06-17T08:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2025-06-17:/python-gotcha-identity-vs-equality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To a new developer &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; can look like an equality check in Python, especially in poorly written tutorials.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-comparisons.html"&gt;comparisons gotcha&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few years ago, I briefly touched on &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-comparisons.html#is-vs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; should ONLY be used if you are checking if two references refer to the same object.
&lt;em&gt;Remember, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; compares object references.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more simply, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; checking value. Let's take a look at a couple examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gotcha"&gt;Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="integers"&gt;Integers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#integers" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python, specifically CPython, caches the values of &lt;code&gt;-5&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;256&lt;/code&gt; (inclusive). This means that these small integer values will always refer to the same object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the phrasing there - "the same object".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of that range, though, the same is not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = 100
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = 100
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = 257
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = 257
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the above examples, using &lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt; would have returned &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. The mistake was assuming that &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; does the same thing. It does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="strings"&gt;Strings&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#strings" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;String interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct immutable string value. Immutable strings can't be changed. Not every string will be interned though. Let's take a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = "Hello"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = "Hello"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = "Hello World"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = "Hello World"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = "Hello_World"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = "Hello_World"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and last example interned the strings, showing that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; refer to the same object. But, the second example - &lt;code&gt;Hello World&lt;/code&gt; - didn't get interned, so &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; refer to different objects. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short and simply answer is that any string that has only numbers, letters or underscores will be interned. Since &lt;code&gt;Hello World&lt;/code&gt; contains a &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt;, it would not be interned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a new developer that has seen tutorials that read &lt;code&gt;if a is True&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;if b is None&lt;/code&gt;, a conditional for integers or strings following the same pattern &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be comparing values. If they test it with small, positive numbers or simple one word strings, the assumption holds up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; is for comparing values! Each of the above examples would return &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; by changing the statement to &lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The few times that &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; is appropriate are when you are checking &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, the &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; majority of the time, you want to use an equality check (&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations"&gt;PEP8 programming recommendations&lt;/a&gt; state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparisons to singletons like &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; should always be done with &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;is not&lt;/code&gt;, never the equality operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linters in the Python ecosystem report on the usage of &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; too. &lt;code&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E711.html"&gt;E711&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;code&gt;Comparison to None should be 'cond is None:'&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;ruff&lt;/code&gt; has a similar report with it's &lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/none-comparison/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; comparison&lt;/a&gt; check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend a linter for your projects to catch this, and other problems that go against best practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading engineering teams across multiple time zones has been a defining part of my career. I have taken courses on how to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-manage-remote-team.html"&gt;manage a remote team&lt;/a&gt;, how to implement &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-teamops-certification.html"&gt;TeamOps&lt;/a&gt; (both offered by &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;) and I've managed teams spanning half of the global time zones, with team members located across every continent except Antarctica. This global distribution brings tremendous advantages in terms of talent access and round-the-clock development capability, but it also presents unique leadership challenges that require intentional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As software development continues to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/remote-work-thoughts-about-offices.html"&gt;embrace remote work&lt;/a&gt; - kind of, it has started falling out of favor since the end of the pandemic - the ability to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/scaling-teams-without-losing-culture.html"&gt;effectively lead and scale distributed engineering teams&lt;/a&gt; has evolved from a nice-to-have skill to a critical competency for senior leaders. The lessons I've learned managing global teams have shaped my leadership approach and provided insights that apply across both to engineering and to the broader organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="building-foundations-for-distributed-success"&gt;Building Foundations for Distributed Success&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#building-foundations-for-distributed-success" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of any successful distributed team begins with &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/top-soft-skills-senior-developers-need.html#excellent-communication"&gt;intentional communication&lt;/a&gt;. Tools like Slack, Zoom (with recording capabilities), Atlassian suite (Jira/Confluence), GitHub/GitLab, and collaborative document platforms like Google Workspace aren't just conveniences. They are the essential connective tissue of distributed teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having the right tools is only the beginning. More important is establishing clear principles for how these tools should be used. In my experience, the most successful distributed teams operate with a strong bias toward asynchronous communication. This means documenting decisions thoroughly, creating detailed specifications in advance of implementation, and ensuring appropriate synchronous discussions are recorded and summarized for team members in different time zones. Things like team meetings, troubleshooting sessions, and deep dives should be recorded and shared so that others can consume this information too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is the backbone of effective collaboration. Unlike co-located teams that can rely on impromptu conversations or whiteboard sessions to clarify questions, distributed teams need comprehensive documentation that stands on its own. This includes architectural decisions, specification documents, onboarding guides, and even meeting notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/remote-work-report/"&gt;study by GitLab in 2021&lt;/a&gt; (during the height of the pandemic) found that less than half of respondants felt their company was sharing company goals, creating and documenting processes and standards or promoting visibility across teams well. Intentional communication is important in all work places, but even more so when everyone is located in geographically different areas of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that building a "document-first" culture pays enormous dividends. When team members know that the first question in response to "How do I...?" will be "Did you check the documentation?", they naturally begin to contribute to and rely on that shared knowledge base. This reduces repeat questions, accelerates onboarding, and creates a more equitable information environment across time zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="decision-making-frameworks-across-time-zones"&gt;Decision-Making Frameworks Across Time Zones&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#decision-making-frameworks-across-time-zones" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging aspects of leading distributed teams is balancing the need for inclusive decision-making with the necessity to move projects forward. Over time, I've developed a time-gated decision framework that respects input from all regions while preventing decision paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-emergency decisions, I post proposals to our shared channels with clear timelines for feedback. For example: "I'll be creating Jira stories based on this architectural approach starting next Monday unless concerns are raised." This provides a minimum of one business day (often more) for team members across all regions to review and comment, while also creating a clear decision point that prevents endless deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decisions requiring input from specific individuals, I'll explicitly mention them in the initial message. This creates accountability while also signaling to others who the key stakeholders are for that particular domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all decisions can wait, of course. Production outages or customer-impacting bugs demand synchronous communication and rapid response. In these cases, available team members need to be empowered to make decisions with the information at hand, with the understanding that these decisions will be reviewed and possibly refined once more of the team is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balancing act of knowing when to wait for comprehensive input versus when to move forward with available information is one of the most nuanced skills in distributed leadership. In my experience, being explicit about which type of decision is being made helps team members adjust their expectations appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="technical-infrastructure-for-global-development"&gt;Technical Infrastructure for Global Development&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#technical-infrastructure-for-global-development" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical infrastructure supporting distributed development deserves particular attention. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which are beneficial for any engineering organization, become absolutely essential for distributed teams. Automated testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes create consistency across time zones and reduce the risk of human error. This isn't limited to just a "time zone" thing though. It creates consistency across the team. Everyone's code, from the newest member of the team to the most veteran member, has their code commits go through the exact same process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code review practices need careful consideration in distributed environments. When reviewers might be asleep during a developer's working hours, teams need clear expectations about review timeframes. I emphasize that while we strive for quick reviews, team members should be prepared to either continue with different work or pivot to another task if a review is delayed. As the team grows and more individuals are working similar hours these delays will reduce, but initially, it is a concern that the team members have delibrately work on so that someone isn't always delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment strategies must also account for global distribution. Whether your team deploys each commit directly to production or follows a more scheduled release cadence, the key is establishing clear, documented processes that anyone on the team can follow regardless of location. When setting up these processes, consider who needs to be available during deployments, how deployment failures will be handled across the team, and whether certain deployment windows should be avoided due to regional holidays or weekend coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the most successful approach is establishing deployment processes that don't require real-time coordination between team members in different time zones. This might mean investing more heavily in automated testing, feature flags, and rollback capabilities, but the resulting independence pays dividends in team efficiency and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-support-model"&gt;A Support Model&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-support-model" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the natural advantages of a globally distributed team is the ability to provide around-the-clock coverage without requiring anyone to work unusual hours. We've implemented a rotation support model, where team members handle support duties during their local working hours. This creates continuous coverage while respecting everyone's work-life balance. Depending on the product, this could mean that the team only provides support during business hours or it could mean that the support follows the sun. In either case, the type of support provided must be clearly communicated to both the team and to end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean team members are never contacted outside working hours. True emergencies sometimes require waking someone with specialized knowledge. However, two important principles guide these situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if someone is contacted outside working hours to address an issue, they receive compensatory time off. This creates accountability in the escalation process. People think twice before waking a colleague unless truly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and perhaps more importantly, each off-hours escalation triggers a review of our documentation and training. If someone needed to be woken for a particular issue, that indicates a gap in our knowledge distribution that needs to be addressed. This transforms what could be a negative experience into an opportunity for team improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this approach creates robust documentation and broader knowledge distribution across the team, reducing the frequency of off-hours disruptions and building resilience into the organization. This is important, because documentation takes time. It's rarely a one shot deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="evaluations-in-distributed-teams"&gt;Evaluations in Distributed Teams&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#evaluations-in-distributed-teams" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating performance fairly across distributed teams requires deliberate attention to measurable outcomes rather than observable behaviors. I focus primarily on deliverables. Are teams hitting their targets and delivering on time and on budget? Are we meeting the KPIs we've established for deployments, code reviews, specifications, feature delivery, and performance improvements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For managers specifically, I evaluate whether they're maintaining regular one-on-one meetings with all team members, regardless of location, and whether they're developing clear career succession and training plans for each report. These expectations apply uniformly across the organization, creating consistency in how leadership effectiveness is measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that geographical distance doesn't create invisible barriers to advancement, I maintain skip-level one-on-ones with team members across all regions. This gives everyone direct access to higher-level leadership and provides me with unfiltered insights into how to team is operating and individual contributions that might otherwise be obscured by distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that managers who excel in distributed environments share certain qualities: they communicate proactively, document thoroughly, avoid making assumptions about team members' contexts, and create equitable opportunities for visibility and recognition regardless of location. These behaviors become key elements in leadership development and promotion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="developing-talent-globally"&gt;Developing Talent Globally&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#developing-talent-globally" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring for distributed teams requires evaluating candidates not just for technical skills but for their ability to thrive in a remote, asynchronous environment. Beyond the job-specific requirements, I look for clear written and verbal communication skills, as team members will interact with colleagues, leaders, and customers from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Comfort with asynchronous work patterns and self-direction is essential, as are strong documentation habits that support knowledge sharing. Cultural adaptability and awareness round out the key attributes that predict success in distributed environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once hired, ensuring equitable career development opportunities across regions becomes essential. During review cycles, we systematically discuss everyone's performance and growth trajectory. I expect managers to speak knowledgeably about each team member's contributions and aspirations, regardless of where they're located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skip-level one-on-ones mentioned earlier serve a dual purpose here. First, they help identify talent that might otherwise be overlooked due to geographical distance from headquarters or senior leadership. These conversations also build relationships that help me understand individual motivations and career goals across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particularly effective practice has been creating cross-regional project teams that give team members exposure to colleagues and challenges outside their immediate locale. This broadens perspectives while creating mentorship and leadership opportunities that might not arise within more regionally confined teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've moved through increasingly senior leadership roles, the principles of effective team management have become even more important to my leadership approach. The future of engineering leadership demands comfort with distributed teams. Demands. Leading a team, whether it's fully remote or hybrid, is a skill that leaders need if they want to have access to talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful technical leaders in this environment will be those who design systems and processes that work asynchronously by default, create cultures where documentation and knowledge sharing are valued and rewarded, and balance inclusive decision-making with the need to move  forward. They will build technical infrastructure that supports distributed development, implement support models that leverage global distribution, ensure performance evaluation focuses on outcomes rather than presence, and develop hiring practices that identify talent suited for distributed work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These capabilities represent the future of engineering leadership at the highest levels. For aspiring technical leaders, developing comfort and competence in distributed team management isn't just a nice-to-haveâit's increasingly essential preparation for senior technical leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>Technical Debt Management: A Strategic Approach</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/tech-debt-management-strategic-approach.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-04-08T09:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-04-08T09:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2025-04-08:/tech-debt-management-strategic-approach.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After navigating technical leadership roles across startups and established corporations, I've come to view technical debt as both inevitable and manageable. It's the leadership approach to this debt that often determines whether a company can maintain momentum or finds itself grinding to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "technical debt" has become a catch-all phrase, it's used to describe anything from poorly written code to outdated systems. But at its core, technical debt represents the very real trade-off of choosing immediate delivery over long-term maintainability. For companies caught between aggressive timelines and the need for sustainable systems, managing this debt becomes more than just a technical challenge. It's a strategic imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="understanding-technical-debt"&gt;Understanding Technical Debt&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-technical-debt" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt manifests differently at various companies. Large organizations struggle with legacy systems built decades ago, while smaller companies struggle with systems built hastily last quarter that are already creaking under unexpected scale or scope expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary sources of technical debt during rapid scaling often emerge from several common scenarios. I've witnessed early architectural decisions made with limited information create significant challenges. When we built our first API at a one startup, we made assumptions about how users would utilize the API and the portal built on top of it that proved incorrect. We made assumptions about our own product line that didn't hold true as we scaled. As our user base grew, as our product line grew, as our internal structure grew, we found that we'd built ourselves into a cage that wasn't easy to build our way out of. Acquisition integration introduces another layer of complexity, as we often need to integrate systems built with different architectural assumptions and technical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature pressure also plays a huge role. When racing to meet competitive threats or capitalize on market opportunities, corners get cut. These aren't necessarily bad decisions at the time, but they accumulate over time. Team rotation creates knowledge gaps. As teams and companies scale, original architects and developers move into management, other roles, or to other companies taking vital context with them if proper knowledge transfer isn't prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "move fast and break things" ethos that drives early success can quickly become a liability if technical debt isn't managed proactively. In these environments, yesterday's clever hack becomes today's bottleneck, and today's workaround becomes tomorrow's single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-real-cost-of-technical-debt"&gt;The Real Cost of Technical Debt&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-real-cost-of-technical-debt" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is often discussed in abstract terms, making it difficult for non-technical stakeholders to appreciate its impact. To make these costs tangible, I find it helpful to categorize them into different areas of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmanaged technical debt progressively slows development. What once took days begins taking weeks as developers navigate around increasingly brittle code. Systems built around technical debt typically require more hands-on management. For example, in one role, we found support was seeing the same pattern of problems over and over again, despite engineering effort to solve the problem. Engineers were spending so much time maintaining these systems that new development slowed to a crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads to what I think is the most damaging aspect of unmanaged technical debit. Stiffled innovation. When engineers spend their creative energy working around limitations rather than solving new problems, competitive advantage erodes. This cost is hardest to quantify but most devastating long-term. Technical debt becomes most visible when it impacts customers. Whether this manifests through outages, performance issues, or security vulnerabilities, it impacts customers in some way. By then, the solution is typically more expensive and disruptive than if addressed proactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="when-to-address-vs-when-to-defer"&gt;When to Address vs. When to Defer&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-address-vs-when-to-defer" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all technical debt requires immediate attention. The key is distinguishing between strategic debt that enables necessary velocity and toxic debt that creates compounding problems. Here's how I approach these decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-upgrade-case-study"&gt;The Upgrade Case Study&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-upgrade-case-study" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, at one company, we faced a critical decision about our API infrastructure. We had built an initial API quickly as a skeleton for the product, but it wasn't designed for the scale and feature set we now needed. As the team grew rapidly, we had to decide whether to focus exclusively on building a new production ready API, or gradually migrate from old to new while continuing feature development on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analysis, we estimated that implementing new product features in the old API would actually take longer than building a robust new API and implementing the new features there first. The tipping point came when our team estimated that one specific new product line would take less time to deliver by building the skeleton of a new API, setting it up properly, and implementing the new feature than it would to build the feature into the current API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clean-cut approach allowed new team members to focus entirely on the new API, infrastructure, and features. They came up to speed quickly by building a product they knew from the ground up. We ported the old API functionality to achieve parity, added new features as an incentive for customers to migrate, and then deprecated and ultimately shut down V1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This counterintuitive approach, where addressing technical debt actually accelerated delivery, is exactly the kind of strategic analysis companies need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-early-is-cheaper"&gt;Why Early Is Cheaper&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-early-is-cheaper" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental principle of technical debt management is that the cost to update almost always increases with time. In my experience, moving one version forward is generally easier than moving two, which is easier than moving three. Waiting until something reaches end-of-life means you're multiple versions behind, increasing the likelihood that functionality you rely on has been deprecated or removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies across development. Finding problems in development is cheaper than finding them in QA, which is cheaper than finding them in production. Security follows this curve most dramatically. Addressing vulnerabilities during development is vastly cheaper than responding to a public security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing technical debt with business stakeholders, this compounding cost curve is the most persuasive argument for proactive management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="making-technical-debt-visible"&gt;Making Technical Debt Visible&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#making-technical-debt-visible" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating organizational awareness around technical debt is essential for managing it effectively. The approaches I've found most effective include visualization tools that make the abstract concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple but powerful approach that worked for us was a "stoplight" system for technical debt. We identified all libraries, frameworks, and language versions in use and tracked their end-of-life dates. These became our "red light" dates - points at which we must update or risk being on unsupported versions. This system helped build a clear priority list and highlighted whether manual maintenance was feasible or automation was needed. Managing 5 dependencies manually is reasonable; managing 500 is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="automation-as-visibility"&gt;Automation as Visibility&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#automation-as-visibility" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools like &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide"&gt;Dependabot&lt;/a&gt; provide ongoing visibility into dependency status. When automated systems continuously generate pull requests for outdated dependencies, the entire organization develops awareness of technical health. These systems make the invisible nature of tech debt visible and turn theoretical discussions about debt into actionable items. It also does it gradually, so it just becomes part of system maintenance, instead of giant maintenance cycles that slow development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing technical debt with non-technical executives, I focus on two key aspects. First is why we need to address it. These reasons vary depending on the scenario and team, but could be something like us being on an unsupported version, or we that spend significant hours weekly working around issues fixed in newer versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second aspect is considering the consequences of deferring. If we remain on an unsupported version, the vendor won't help when problems arise or at least not cheaply. There might be active exploits in the wild for the version of a library we are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also include impact analysis on existing priorities. If properly planned, technical debt work fits into existing timelines with minimal disruption. When that's not possible, I clearly explain the trade-offs and impacts of both addressing and deferring the debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cultural-elements-of-technical-debt-management"&gt;Cultural Elements of Technical Debt Management&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#cultural-elements-of-technical-debt-management" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt management isn't only a technical practice. It's a cultural one too. The most successful approaches I've seen embed debt management into everyday work rather than treating it as an occasional "debt sprint."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture of automating away low-level technical debt proved crucial in my experience. Implementing tools like Dependabot, &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/"&gt;OWASP&lt;/a&gt; scans, and &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/accessibility_testing/"&gt;accessibility checks&lt;/a&gt; reduced the time engineers spent worrying about these issues because they were handled behind the scenes. This automation-first approach served multiple purposes. It baked prevention into the development process, encouraged engineers to think about security, accessibility, and dependencies early, demonstrated organizational commitment to technical excellence, and created a positive ripple effect as other teams adopted similar practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one team successfully automated technical debt management, others naturally followed suit. This created a culture of continuous improvement rather than periodic cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particularly effective practice I found was assigning new engineers small technical debt tasks as their first projects. This might be a library update, minor bug fix, or addressing a potential security flaw. New engineers made immediate, valuable contributions while building confidence in a new system by completing manageable tasks. The team addressed technical debt items that might otherwise struggle for prioritization, documentation got updated based on fresh perspectives, and new team members learned team processes in a low-pressure context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By introducing technical debt management during onboarding, we established it as a normal part of engineering work instead of an occassional activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-continuous-approach"&gt;The Continuous Approach&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-continuous-approach" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than scheduling occasional "technical debt sprints" that disrupt normal work, I've found greater success in making debt reduction a continuous process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional technical debt sprints create several problems. They interrupt feature development momentum, treat technical excellence as exceptional rather than normal, and encourage deferring small fixes that could be handled immediately to "some other time".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I've found treating technical debt like regular household maintenance works better. By making small, continuous improvements, you prevent the need for major renovations in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With automated tools handling routine updates, engineering teams can focus on substantive technical debt such as infrastructure improvements, major framework upgrades, outdated UI refreshes, and performance bottlenecks. These larger initiatives deserve careful planning and dedicated time, but they should still be approached as part of normal development cycles rather than exceptional activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most efficient technical debt management strategy I've witnessed is preventing unnecessary debt in the first place. During high-growth periods, implementing automated checks early in the development process caught potential issues before they became embedded in our systems. Clear standards for code quality, security, and architecture provided guidance without imposing unnecessary constraints. The key was establishing these standards as enablers rather than barriers. They helped developers make good decisions quickly rather than slowing them down with bureaucracy. It also eliminates back and forth during code review - "This line is 120 character", "This function call should have parameters on new lines". Bake that into your linter that every developer must use and those discussions will never need to occur again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technical investments I've seen pay dividends by preventing debt accumulation. Comprehensive test suites caught regressions early. CI/CD pipelines enforced quality standards. Architecture decision records preserved context. Service boundaries limited the spread of technical compromises. These investments created an environment where quality was the path of least resistance rather than an additional burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience in multiple leadership roles, when managed effectively, technical debt becomes not just a necessary evil but a strategic tool. By making conscious decisions about when to take on debt and when to pay it down, companies can maintain the velocity needed for market success while building sustainable technical foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that making debt visible through automation, metrics, and clear communication ensures technical debt is part of strategic conversations. Embedding debt management in culture builds technical excellence into everyday practices rather than occasional initiatives. Focusing on prevention by investing in tools and practices makes it easier to do things right than to create new debt. Being strategic about remediation means addressing debt that limits key business initiatives while deferring debt that doesn't impact current priorities. Measuring the impact by tracking before-and-after metrics demonstrates the value of technical debt reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As engineering leaders, our role isn't to eliminate all technical debt. That would be neither possible nor desirable. Instead, our job is to manage technical debt as thoughtfully as we would manage financial debt. The goal is to take it on deliberately when the terms make sense, monitoring its impact, and paying it down strategically to maximize long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>Scaling Engineering Teams: From 5 to 50+ Without Losing Your Culture</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/scaling-teams-without-losing-culture.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-04-01T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2025-04-01:/scaling-teams-without-losing-culture.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scaling engineering teams is about much more than just adding headcount. It's about creating sustainable growth that preserves the core elements of your culture while evolving systems to support a larger organization. Here are a few of my thoughts about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;After nearly two decades in software development leadership and multiple VP-level roles, I've learned that scaling engineering teams is about much more than just adding headcount. It's about creating sustainable growth that preserves the core elements of your culture while evolving systems to support a larger organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-challenges-of-rapid-growth"&gt;The Challenges of Rapid Growth&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-challenges-of-rapid-growth" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scaling engineering teams, I faced two consistent challenges that required thoughtful solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="challenge-1-accelerated-hiring-while-maintaining-quality"&gt;Challenge 1: Accelerated Hiring While Maintaining Quality&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#challenge-1-accelerated-hiring-while-maintaining-quality" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring quickly while finding candidates with the right skillsets is one of the most difficult aspects of scaling. The pressure to fill seats can easily lead to compromising on talent quality or cultural fit. I've found that being crystal clear about technical requirements while remaining flexible about where a candidate's talents can best serve the organization helps thread this needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ideal-engineering-interviews.html"&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;, I focus on diving deep into candidates' past projects rather than relying solely on technical assessments. If an engineer discusses a project and emphasizes backend architecture and database design while only briefly touching on UI elements, this reveals their true areas of expertise. I always follow up by asking whether they want to continue developing in those areas or expand into new ones. Both answers are valuableâthey help me understand not just what the candidate can do today, but how they might grow tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/top-soft-skills-senior-developers-need.html"&gt;Soft skills are incredibly important&lt;/a&gt;. An engineer that takes ownership of the system, is willing to try an unknown, likes mentoring (and being mentored), and can communicate with others in a professional and empathic manner can bring much more than their technical skills to a growing team. Obviously you need that technical skill, but an engineer isn't a machine. They should be able to do more than sling code, rebuild a server, or make a system diagram. I am hiring someone for their whole set of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="challenge-2-knowledge-transfer-at-scale"&gt;Challenge 2: Knowledge Transfer at Scale&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#challenge-2-knowledge-transfer-at-scale" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In small teams, knowledge naturally diffuses through daily interactions. As teams grow, this organic process breaks down, creating knowledge silos and redundant work. Each wave of engineers we onboarded faced steeper learning curves without proper documentation and orientation.
Our solution was to make each cohort of new hires part of the knowledge-building process. Every wave of engineers contributed to our knowledge bases, improving the experience for the next group. We implemented, essentially, an onboarding buddy system that paired new engineers with each other to build relationships, while also connecting them with experienced team members who could fill in knowledge gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other benefit of these types of improvements, is that is supports &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/remote-work-thoughts-about-offices.html"&gt;asynchronous communication and remote work&lt;/a&gt;. Remote work and hybrid work have grown in popularity, especially since 2020. Building knowledge transfers through tooling that doesn't expect the entire team to be in a single location provides so much &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; to others. Someone can catch up in a Slack channel later, or read a Confluence article tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="culture-preservation-techniques-that-work"&gt;Culture Preservation Techniques That Work&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#culture-preservation-techniques-that-work" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining culture during growth requires intentionality. Here are strategies I've found effective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediate Integration into Meaningful Work: New team members were immediately included in team ceremonies and assigned meaningful tasksânot just busywork. This sent a clear message: you're a valued contributor from day one. By giving new engineers real problems to solve immediately, they quickly identified with the team's mission and felt ownership of their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public Knowledge Sharing: We instituted a rule that all support work must occur in public channels. This transparency accomplished several things. New engineers could observe troubleshooting in real-time allowing everyone to learn from each issue that arose. Team members could spot when someone was solving a previously addressed problem which helped find patterns of recurring issues. These became visible, highlighting systemic problems that needed permanent fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Documentation: A picture truly is worth a thousand words on day one. System architecture diagrams, workflow charts, and even team organization maps help new engineers orient themselves quickly. We continually updated these visual aids as our systems and teams evolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="evolution-of-team-structure-and-communication"&gt;Evolution of Team Structure and Communication&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#evolution-of-team-structure-and-communication" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adaptive-team-structures"&gt;Adaptive Team Structures&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#adaptive-team-structures" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no one-size-fits-all approach to team structure during scaling phases. I've built dedicated backend, frontend, and QA teams, and I've also created cross-functional pods. The right approach depends on your product, business needs, and the existing strengths of your team.
What matters most is acknowledging that your structure must evolve as you grow. The flat organization that worked at 5 engineers simply won't function at 50. Being transparent about these necessary changes helps the team understand why restructuring happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="communication-cascade"&gt;Communication Cascade&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#communication-cascade" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As teams grow, communication needs to flow through multiple channels. While I always strive to stay hands-on and close to the work, the reality of executive leadership means I can't directly communicate with everyone daily. Building a strong communication cascade through direct managers becomes essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain regular one-on-one meetings with my direct reports and hold skip-level meetings on a consistent cadence. I also encourage my direct reports to do the same with their teams. This creates multiple pathways for information to flow up and down the organization.
Crucially, engineers need to see their feedback traveling up the chain and resulting in actual changes. When team members witness their input driving decisions, they remain engaged in the communication process and feel valued for their insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="measuring-success-beyond-headcount"&gt;Measuring Success Beyond Headcount&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-success-beyond-headcount" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding engineers is easyâensuring they contribute effectively is the real challenge. Here are metrics I've found valuable for measuring successful scaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to first meaningful commit: How quickly can a new engineer contribute value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature deployment velocity: Is delivery speed maintaining or improving as the team grows?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New product launch timelines: Are we bringing innovations to market faster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support queue metrics: Are new engineers getting involved in support while maintaining quality and response times?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These indicators help identify whether your growing team is becoming more capable or just more numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-lesson-id-apply-to-future-scaling-efforts"&gt;The Lesson I'd Apply to Future Scaling Efforts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-lesson-id-apply-to-future-scaling-efforts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were scaling a team again tomorrow, I'd place even greater emphasis on breaking down business expectations into clearly defined incremental goals. Saying "we're adding X engineers to deliver Y major initiative" creates unrealistic timelines and pressure.
New engineers need time to contribute meaningfully to large tasks. By defining a granular priority list with visible intermediate steps, both new and existing engineers can march toward tangible milestones rather than an intimidating "big thing" with unclear pathways to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cross-team-integration-from-day-one"&gt;Cross-Team Integration from Day One&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#cross-team-integration-from-day-one" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've learned the critical importance of ensuring engineering teams aren't isolated from other departments. As engineers onboard and learn, they should continuously interact with product, sales, customer success, and other functions.
This cross-functional exposure provides vital context about why certain features are requested or designed in specific ways. Engineers who understand the business rationale make better technical decisions and can anticipate future needs.
For example, understanding upcoming business requirements helps engineers build flexibility into systems where it will actually be needed, rather than adding unnecessary complexity. Building with the right level of flexibility now is infinitely easier than redesigning systems later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling engineering teams successfully requires balancing technical excellence, cultural preservation, and business alignment. By implementing thoughtful onboarding processes, maintaining transparent communication, measuring meaningful metrics, and keeping engineers connected to the broader business context, you can grow your team without losing what made it special in the first place.
The journey from 5 to 50+ engineers is challenging, but with intentional leadership, it can result in not just a larger team, but a more capable, cohesive and impactful organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>My first experiences with a laser cutter</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/first-laser-cutter-experiences.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-01-02T10:15:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-02T10:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2025-01-02:/first-laser-cutter-experiences.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My local library recently received a Glowforge for their patrons to utilize. This article is about my experiences using the machine&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My local library spent a lot of time and money remodeling the last few years. Part of this remodel was adding an Innovation Lab with different tools that the public can utilize. These include a Cricut cutter, a Glowforge, a couple 3D printers, sewing machines, a T-shirt screen printer, and a few others I can't recall off hand. I am excited to try out several of these, but started with the laser cutter, because I have a home project that needs a few small things cut and engraved that I wasn't sure how I was going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end goal is to get a set of two inch by one inch rectangles with various years engraved, scored or cut so that I can use these as labels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-simple-start"&gt;A simple start&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-simple-start" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research, I found that what I wanted was relatively simple - at least compared to what the machine is able to do. To do more advanced things, I'd have to learn a lot more about how some software tools operate. For my project though, I used &lt;a href="https://inkscape.org/"&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt;. I started by setting up the rectangle I wanted to use, rounding the corners, and adding a year to engrave. This became my basic template, to ensure that everything was the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='A basic rounded rectangle with "2009" engraved' src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_cut_engrave.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of my SVG files, I only used three colors: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red for cuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black for engrave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue for scoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I read the Glowforge can handle different colors, I noticed that other tooling and software could not and used these three colors. If I ever get access to another laser cutter - or buy one of my own - I don't want to have to redo all of my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing at this step was to select the text, then Text-&amp;gt;Object to path. Without this step, the Glowforge application didn't see the text, just the rectangle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-fancy"&gt;Getting Fancy&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-fancy" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had a basic cut done on basswood proof grade material from Glowforge, I wanted to try a few other designs. All of my examples below are using 2009, because that's the set I grabbed when taking pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='A basic rounded rectangle with background engraved so "2009" pops out' src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_background_engraved.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I engraved the background, instead of the text, so that the year would pop out. I didn't end up liking this one very much, because it makes the material so much thinner. This is obvious when I had multiple tiles of years that had not all been engraved this way. The thinness made these specific tiles feel flimsy. Since I didn't want to use this pattern for all years for the project, it wasn't going to work for only a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Black acrylic with an outer border" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_black_unmasked.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a couple acrylic colors - Black and Blue - to see how it'd look. In this test, I wanted to deal with the thinness I mentioned above too. I did this by adding a small border around the outside, so that when the tiles were side by side, the outer edges were all the same thickness. I liked how this looked and would end up using a portion of this in some final designs. The black acrylic turned out well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue acrylic with an outer border, still with masking tape" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_blue_masked.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn't like the blue acrylic. This is how blue looks with the masking tape still in place. This tape is is to prevent scorching marks. It looks ok with the tape in place, but once removed, the blue text just kind of got lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue acrylic without an outer border, with no masking tape" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_blue_unmasked.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test didn't have the outer border, but I don't think that would have helped me like it any better. The blue text just gets lost from any angle other than straight on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Individual numeral cut outs" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_individual.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut out individual numbers as well. These look really good. Unfortunately, I didn't plan beyond the cut out, and dealing with four individual numerals on each item I wanted to label very quickly became a ton of work to ensure they were unmasked, aligned, and glued into place. They also didn't end up looking as good as the tiled items once I had them in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I should have learned from this experiment that I was vaguely aware of, but didn't pay attention to because I was focused on the numbers themselves, was that the inner part of the numbers would come out. This was more important in the next two experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stacking acrylic on top of a wooden background" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/laser_cutter/2009_stacked.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I had decided that I liked how the black acrylic looked, but wanted to highlight a few years. I attempted one last test to see if I could utilize the narrower engraved look and stack it on top of another. The original goal had been to end up with the same thickness as the other tiles, but that didn't work as planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, for the few years that I needed to highlight, this worked very well. To build this, I kept the lower layer - the wood - the same size as other tiles. I engraved like I had done for the acrylic tests above. Then on the acrylic itself, I made it the size of the inner border and reversed the numerals. I did this because I originally tested by engraving the acrylic down to size too, but it didn't look good. Instead, I kept the acrylic the original width and just cut out the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once stacked and glued together, I realized that I hadn't kept the inner pieces of the zeros. It is easy enough to go cut out a couple more numbers at the library, but at the same time, not bothering me enough to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays, I completed the project and got everything labeled. I'm pleased with how it turned out. I was not surprised at how easy the Glowforge itself is to use. Learning how to design the SVG cut files took longer than I expected. There are likely other software tools that could do the job better, but for this small project and for some experiments, Inkscape worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my next project, I'd like to finish off the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/control-power-wled-relay.html"&gt;WLED&lt;/a&gt; work I did last summer. The original project didn't work as expected, but the WLED portion worked wonderfully. I could build a couple stand lights and laser cut out the base. I'd have to figure out how to model the aluminium rail to cut it correctly, but that sound like a fun task.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="technical"/><category term="meta"/></entry><entry><title>Moving MS Authenticator to a new phone without a personal account</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/ms-authenticator-without-personal-account.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2024-11-27T12:15:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-11-27T12:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2024-11-27:/ms-authenticator-without-personal-account.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Authenticator application allows you to transfer tokens to a new device if you have a personal Microsoft account. How do you do it if you don't have a personal account? This is a quick walk through of what worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work utilizes the Microsoft Authenticator app as their 2FA application of choice. It's not my favorite, but it does what it needs to do, and since I only use the application for work things, it's nice to keep work accounts out of personal accounts in my other 2FA application. Recently, I got a new phone, and needed to migrate everything over to that device. As an aside, Android continues to make this easier and easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard advice on how to migrate your token to a new device is to enable cloud backup, sign in to the new device and import the backup. The problem is when you go to enable Cloud Backup from the settings, you are hit with this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You need a personal Microsoft account to use cloud backup"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't have a personal Microsoft account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside: I can't provide screenshots of the Android application for this post because the application prevents screenshots from being taken. I appreciate this feature as part of the application for security purposes, but it's annoying when trying to write about it. Oh well...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alternative-to-cloud-backup"&gt;Alternative to Cloud Backup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-to-cloud-backup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set up MFA on my work account - obviously - and can access settings through the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/mfasetup"&gt;Microsoft MFA setup page&lt;/a&gt;. From here, you'll be on the Security Info page. It will show the current authenticator device being utilized. You'll need the old device during this process to authenticate one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Microsoft security information page showing my current MS Authenticator device" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/ms_authenticator/security_info.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on "Add sign-in method" and then "Microsoft Authenticator"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Options to pick from for adding a new signin method. For this, select Microsoft Authenticator" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/ms_authenticator/new_method.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your phone, ensure you have the MS Authenticator application installed. Then follow the on screen prompts between your computer and your new phone. You'll select "Work or School" and then scan the QR code that is common with 2FA/MFA applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step in the process will be to send an authentication request to the new device. Do so, enter the verification code, and your new device will be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Device is approved after entering your verification code" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/ms_authenticator/approved_device.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you wrap this up by removing your old device from the Security Info section now that the new device is approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft authenticator application doesn't make moving to a new device as easy as some of its competitors. The requirement for a personal Microsoft account to go through the most commonly recommended way is also a non-starter if you don't have such an account already. Fortunately, the alternative posted above ended up working just fine. I assume I'll need a new phone again, and this should help at least me, remember that there is an easy enough way to migrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Format USB drive with EFI partition in Windows</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/format-efi-usb-windows.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2024-11-13T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-11-13T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2024-11-13:/format-efi-usb-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Windows protects EFI partitions from being deleted. This article is a quick walkthrough on how to format a USB drive with an EFI partition within Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to collect USB drives. They are handed out at conferences. They are used as recovery media for new machines. They just randomly appear on my desk. I use them to build live Linux CDs, transferring media from one device to another, building recovery media, and generally the things you'd expect a USB drive to be used for. Generally, when I use a USB drive the first thing I do is format it. My USB drives are not for long term storage and I consider anything on them used one time then the drive goes back to the bin for reuse another time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An annoyance with this, though, is that when I use a drive to build a bootable backup media, often times an EFI partition will be created. As soon as this is created, Windows prevents that partition from being deleted in the future without taking additional steps. I have to go look those up every time because I do it infrequently enough to remember. This is a simple walkthrough of my process to solve this problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A USB drive with an EFI partition looks like this within the Disk Management tool in Windows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A USB drive with an EFI partition and an unallocated partition" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/efi-partition.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="format-an-efi-partition"&gt;Format an EFI Partition&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#format-an-efi-partition" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove this partition, utilize the built in &lt;code&gt;diskpart&lt;/code&gt; tool. &lt;code&gt;Win&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and type in &lt;code&gt;diskpart&lt;/code&gt; and allow the application to run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you need to find which drive you want to adjust partitions on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition attention"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure you select the correct disk. Failure to do so could result in an inoperable system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug the USB drive into the machine and run &lt;code&gt;list disk&lt;/code&gt; to see all available disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISKPART&amp;gt; list disk

Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
--------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---
Disk 0    Online         3726 GB  1024 KB        &lt;span class="gs"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gs"&gt;Disk 1    Online          931 GB  1024 KB        *&lt;/span&gt;
Disk 2    Online           14 GB    14 GB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that I have 3 drives detected. &lt;code&gt;Disk 2&lt;/code&gt; is my USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISKPART&amp;gt; sel disk 2

Disk 2 is now the selected disk.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then show the partitions on the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISKPART&amp;gt; list partition

Partition ###  Type              Size     Offset
-------------  ----------------  -------  -------
Partition 1    System            4000 KB   850 KB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a single partition - the EFI partition. The rest of the drive is unallocated, as the screenshot above shows. Select this partition. IF you have multiple partitions listed, you'll need to determine which is the EFI partition. In my case, since I'm going to be formatting the entire drive anyway, if there were multiple listed I'd select and delete each individual partition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISKPART&amp;gt; sel partition 1

Partition 1 is now the selected partition.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition attention"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These commands will delete a partition. If you haven't selected the right drive or partition things will break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, delete the EFI partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISKPART&amp;gt; delete partition override
DiskPart successfully deleted the selected partition.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to continue my summer project of setting up some outdoor LED lights. &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/update-wled-ericsity-controller-0141.html"&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ericsity-Controller-Addressable-WS2812B-SK6812/dp/B0CNVXY8NX"&gt;set up and updated the Ericsity controller&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://kno.wled.ge/"&gt;WLED&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am putting up approximiately 20 meters - 65 feet - of LEDs. Total this will be nearly 2,000 individual LEDs and approximately 665 individually controlled LED segments (3 LEDs per segment). This will take more power than the little controller can handle. To demonstrate the problem of powering all of these LEDs with only the controller, look at this image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Power drop across 20 meters of LEDs" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/voltage-drop.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These strips are wired with the end of one strip connected to the start of the next. The top strip is connected directly to the controller. The one below is the end of strip two, followed by the start of strip three and the bottom is the very end of the full run of LEDs. The lights are all set to the same color, but as you can see they clearly aren't the same color. The voltage drop across 65 feet of LEDs means that the LEDs are the end can't get enough power to match their earlier siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="power-injection"&gt;Power Injection&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#power-injection" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this specific problem is to inject power into the LED strips. I picked up some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0957T1S9C"&gt;WAGO connectors&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXTP524R"&gt;NUOFUWEI power supply&lt;/a&gt;. I also had some 18 guage wire on hand. With this power unit, I can easily set up three injection points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to inject power at the start of strip 1, right where the controller is connecting in the image above. Then inject between strips 2 and 3, in the middle of the run. Finally, I injected power at the end of strip 4. With these three, equally spaced injection points, I was able to get a nice uniform color across the entire 20 meter run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="LED strip with power injection shows uniform coloring" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/equal-voltage.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem Solved! Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="turning-off-the-psu"&gt;Turning off the PSU&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#turning-off-the-psu" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WLED controls the lights, but doesn't control the power supply with this wiring setup. Turning off the lights within WLED does turn off the LEDs, but the power supply continues to run. It's not drawing at full load, but it is drawing power and the cooling fan is active. It's noticable and unneeded. I want a way to turn off the power supply AND the LEDs at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't power the WLED controller from the large power supply to do this, because if I turn off the power supply that'd also turn off the WLED controller. I'll need to power the WLED controller independently from the lights. Fortunately, this won't be a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is figuring out how I can use WLED to control the larger power supply. Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://kno.wled.ge/features/relay-control/"&gt;WLED has the ability to control a relay&lt;/a&gt;, which I can use to control the power supply. The Ericsity controller also has two output data pins. While I don't think the second one was built in to control a relay, it works perfectly here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wiring"&gt;Wiring&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#wiring" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased a &lt;a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/p/hi-letgo-5-v-1-channel-relay-mod/2RDBGLR8VL"&gt;HiLetGo relay&lt;/a&gt; so that I could toggle the larger power supply on and off. To do this, it's important that the data line and the ground are common among the controller, the power supply and the LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Wiring diagram for WLED controller, external power supply, LEDs and a relay controlling the external PSU" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/deck-lights-wled.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram above is a rough schematic of how I wired this. The controller sends data, but not power, to the LEDs. Data was on GPIO 16. The important part here is that the data line is shared across all of the strips. I did not need a signal booster for my project, and because I'm about to use the second exposed data channel for the relay, I had to ensure that this single channel could send a signal down the entire length of the strip. Fortunately, I didn't have any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiring ground was tied into the PSU and the LEDs as well. The common ground is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the diagram is the relay. I put this relay between the wall and the PSU. When WLED sent an &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; signal, it would close the relay, turning on the PSU and the LEDs. GPIO 2 was tied to the relay and within &lt;code&gt;LED Preferences&lt;/code&gt;, the Relay Pin was set to GPIO 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick power cycle from within WLED is required at this point. Press the power button in the UI to turn everything off, press it once more to turn it on. As long as the PSU is plugged into the wall, you should here it fire up and see the LEDs turn on. If you press the power button again, the LEDs turn off, the relay clicks, shuts down the PSU and only the WLED controller remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="success"&gt;Success&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#success" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the relay in place, the LEDs don't draw phantom power while off because the PSU isn't active. The added benefit, at least for this specific power unit, is the the fans aren't running constantly so it's not as loud. While this will eventually be outside, I'd still prefer to not hear the fan when the lights are off. While they are active it's not going to be bothering me, because I'll likely have music playing for the sound reactive features which will easily be louder than this fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the project is going to be to get this set up outside. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="wled"/></entry><entry><title>Setting up and updating the Ericsity WLED Controller from 0.13.3 to 0.14.1</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/update-wled-ericsity-controller-0141.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2024-06-20T15:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-06-20T15:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2024-06-20:/update-wled-ericsity-controller-0141.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Ericsity WLED controller comes with WLED 0.13.3 preinstalled and only offers the ability to update to 0.13.4.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My summer time project this year is to set up some LED lights outside. After testing out a couple Govee strips that I didn't like because I couldn't diffuse the individual lights away, I finally found an LED strip I liked. The next step was to control these strips so that I could do more than solid colors or the default rainbow every LED strip has. I settled on using the amazing &lt;a href="https://kno.wled.ge/"&gt;WLED project&lt;/a&gt; to control the lights. To speed up the project, I decided to get a prebuilt controller and eventually selected the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ericsity-Controller-Addressable-WS2812B-SK6812/dp/B0CNVXY8NX"&gt;Ericsity controller with a built in mic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: This post is just about how I updated the controller. The next article in the post is available, and talks about how &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/control-power-wled-relay.html"&gt;I am controlling a larger power supply with the WLED controller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controller arrived and was easy to set up. I wired up my strips in the basement to ensure I didn't have any power problems and then determined where I needed to make cuts and solder points once this was outside. Then I went to set up &lt;a href="https://kno.wled.ge/features/segments/"&gt;segments&lt;/a&gt; in WLED so that I could control effects in specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I quickly encountered was that I am outlining my deck with these lights and right in the middle of the deck is a set of steps that I also wanted to light up and then the rest of the deck rail. WLED doesn't have the ability (at least that I've found) to span an effect across multiple segments and I'd need multiple segments for this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At minimium I'd need 3 segments - The rail, the steps, the rest of the rail. If I want an effect to span the entire rail, I can't do that with the steps in the middle. Further research pointed me to the ability to &lt;a href="https://kno.wled.ge/advanced/mapping/"&gt;remap the physical LED order&lt;/a&gt; to a logical LED order. After trying to set this up, it wasn't feature complete in 0.13, but did appear to be in 0.14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Ericsity - rightfully so - utilizes a &lt;a href="https://github.com/atuline/WLED"&gt;stable version of WLED&lt;/a&gt; that only allows you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/atuline/WLED/releases"&gt;update to 0.13.4&lt;/a&gt; and the README has the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository is still maintained, and will receive bugfixes. However no new features will be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="WLED Sound Reactive update page showing that upgrades are only available through version 0.13.4" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/wled-update-page.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-ericsity-controller"&gt;Setting up Ericsity Controller&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-ericsity-controller" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a step back and get the controller set up and then focus on upgrading it. Fortunately, Ericsity makes this pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is to plug in the controller. After a few seconds, you will see a new network available on your phone called &lt;code&gt;WLED-AP&lt;/code&gt;. Join that network. From your browser navigate to &lt;code&gt;4.3.2.1&lt;/code&gt; and select "WIFI SETTINGS". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="WLED install page" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/install1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to add this controller to your wireless network. Do this by adding your network name and password into the first two text boxes. I also updated the mDNS setting, but that's optional. Then save and connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="WLED network set up page" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/install2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, install the WLED mobile application if you are going to manage this via your phone. On an android device you can find it in the Google Play store with the name &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aircoookie.WLED&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;WLED&lt;/a&gt;. Reconnect to your wireless network and the one you just added the controller to. Once installed and reconnected to the network, open the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have already installed and configured a controller, you'll see your previous controllers listed. To add the new controller, click on the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; sign in the upper right. Then "Start Discovery". When the controller is found, you can press the check button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Searching for and adding a new controller to the WLED application" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/install3.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new controller will be listed on the main WLED page with the default name of &lt;code&gt;WLED-SoundReactive&lt;/code&gt;. Select that controller by tapping it. Then select "Config" along the top and "Security &amp;amp; Updates" at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll all the way down to the bottom of this page and you should see that you have the following version installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WLED SR version 0.13.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-to-014x"&gt;Update to 0.14.x&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#update-to-014x" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Security &amp;amp; Updates page, it makes sense to try and perform and update. If you click "Manual OTA Update" you'll notice that only version &lt;code&gt;0.13.3&lt;/code&gt; is available via this link though. It's time to do a manual update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am utilizing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED"&gt;MoonModules branch&lt;/a&gt; because the README for the default install says that changes should be made against this branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull Requests should be created against the MoonModules mdev branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I performed this OTA upgrade from my computer by navigating to the mDNS I set up previously. It can also be accessed by the IP address of the controller in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this post, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED/releases"&gt;current release&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;code&gt;0.14.1-b30&lt;/code&gt;. This was released approximately 6 months ago. I briefly skimmed through recent issues and pull requests to see if I should find a more recent build. There was an &lt;a href="https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED/issues/130"&gt;crash issue&lt;/a&gt; reported with the &lt;code&gt;ripple&lt;/code&gt; effects. Since I like that particular effect, I decided to go with a newer build than the official release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="official-build"&gt;Official build&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#official-build" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to stick with an official release, navigate to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED/releases"&gt;release page&lt;/a&gt; and download the binary file you want to install. For the Ericsity, I found that the generic ESP32 build worked. If you want to use this, look for the file titled &lt;code&gt;WLEDMM_0.14.1-b30.36_esp32_4MB_M.bin&lt;/code&gt;. You could also use the &lt;code&gt;WLEDMM_0.14.1-b30.36_esp32_4MB_S.bin&lt;/code&gt;. Download this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="selecting-a-more-recent-build"&gt;Selecting a more recent build&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-a-more-recent-build" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted a fix for the item I &lt;a href="https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED/issues/130"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;, I opted to download a recent build of the &lt;code&gt;mdev&lt;/code&gt; branch. This can be accomplished by navigating to the build pipeline and filtering for the &lt;code&gt;mdev&lt;/code&gt; branch. This is on Github and available via this direct link to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED/actions/workflows/wled-ci.yml?query=branch%3Amdev"&gt;mdev pipeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Recent builds on Github. Look for mdev branch" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/github-builds.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, select the build you want and scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. Find the binary you want to download. In my case, I wanted the &lt;code&gt;firmware-esp32_4MB_M&lt;/code&gt; and download it. Once downloaded, extract it so that you can upload the &lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt; file within the WLED page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Select the build to utilize. For the Ericsity controller, I found the firmware-esp32_4MB_M version works" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/github-build-version.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="press-the-button"&gt;Press the button!&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#press-the-button" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WLED's Security and Update page, select this binary and then click "Update!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Upload the binary to utilize as the new image" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/update1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update took less than a minute for me. While the new image was being installed, I was told not to close or refresh the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Update installing, don't close or refresh" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/update2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the update is complete, the controller will reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Update complete, rebooting" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/update3.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm that everything has been updated, click on "Config". Immediately, you'll notice a lot more options. Scroll to the bottom and select "Security &amp;amp; Updates" and at the bottom you'll have an About section that lists the version you selected to install. Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WLEDMM version 0.14.1-b31.38 â¾&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fixing-sound-reactive"&gt;Fixing Sound Reactive&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-sound-reactive" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During testing, I noticed that the sound reaction wasn't working. I found the AudioReactive plugin was disabled by default. This is an easy fix. In the WLED application (or web page), click on "Info" then click the power button icon next to "AudioReactive". However, this isn't enough to solve the problem. Click on "Config" then scroll down to AudioReactive. First make sure it is enabled (it should be after the power button selection above). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digitalmic section needs to be modified. The Ericsity controller has the microphone on the following pins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microphone Type: Generic I2S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pin I2S SD: 26&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pin I2S WS: 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pin I2S SCK: 21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Correct audio settings for Ericsity controller. Pin 26 for SD, Pin 5 for WS and Pin 21 for SCK" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/correct-audio.png"/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that pin 5 was selected for another plugin. If you find this too, navigate back to Config page and select "Rotary-Encoder". I don't utilize this plugin, but it is part of the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; build I downloaded. Disable the plugin and change the &lt;code&gt;CLK Pin&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. Then save this change and go back to the AudioReactive plugin and set it up with the pin layout above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Disable the Rotary-Encoder plugin and set the CLK pin to undefined" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/wled/disabled-plugin.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, reboot the controller by selecting "Info" and rebooting the controller at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="good-to-go"&gt;Good to go&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#good-to-go" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the controller has rebooted, audio reactions are working again. The branch I've updated by controller to is actively maintained for the 0.14 branch, even if it is several months behind the main line. I'm satisfied with this for now and will begin experimenting with the led mappings that I need that started this entire upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="wled"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: strip, lstrip, rstrip can remove more than expected</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-strip-functions-unexpected-behavior.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2024-03-29T09:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-03-29T09:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2024-03-29:/python-gotcha-strip-functions-unexpected-behavior.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Python strip, lstrip, and rstrip functions can have unexpected behavior.

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, you've cleaned your fair share of dirty strings. Removing leading or trailing spaces is probably one of the most common things done to user input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, this is done with the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.strip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#str.lstrip"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.lstrip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.rstrip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; functions and generally looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of &lt;strong&gt;characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a list of strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is explicitly spelled out in the documentation, with an example, showing what the implications are. However, for a new developer, it's unexpected behavior. After all, these seem like intutive functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example with my does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receives a list of characters to remove. In this case it is all letters in my last name, plus the space character: &lt;code&gt;wegner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower case all letters in the input string, resulting in &lt;code&gt;andrew wegner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the right hand side of the string, begin removing characters that are in the input list. Stop when you encounter a character not in the list. In this case that means that &lt;code&gt;rengew wer&lt;/code&gt; are removed (right to left) and then the &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;andrew&lt;/code&gt; is encountered so that &lt;code&gt;rstrip&lt;/code&gt; function stops. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the remaining string of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has two functions that will correctly remove a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#str.removesuffix"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.removesuffix()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#str.removeprefix"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.removeprefix()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for right and left side removals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "Andrew Wegner".lower().removesuffix(" wegner")
'andrew'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two functions were introduced in Python 3.9 as part of &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0616/"&gt;PEP-616&lt;/a&gt;. In the PEP, it explicitly calls out the confusion users have about the &lt;code&gt;*strip()&lt;/code&gt; functions and how they behave. These two were introduced to allow the desired behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important note is that these two &lt;code&gt;remove*&lt;/code&gt; functions will only remove &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt; one instance of the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "Andrew Wegner Wegner".lower().removesuffix(" wegner")

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently needed to poke around an APK. I'd done this sort of thing before, but it's been years so the process of setting up an Android environment was unfamilar. Instead of spending a day reimmersing myself for what was (hopefully) going to be a 10-15 minute thing, I turned to another tool: &lt;a href="https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF"&gt;Mobile Security Framework&lt;/a&gt; (also known as MobSF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-docker"&gt;Setting up Docker&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-docker" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless blog posts, articles, and YouTube videos on how to set up the perfect docker environment. This was a quick task. I didn't need "perfect", I needed good enough. At the time, I was on a Windows 11 machine, so that's what I had to work with. The goal was to &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/"&gt;get Docker&lt;/a&gt; operational as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? MobSF has a quick setup with two lines of Docker code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/"&gt;Install Docker for Windows&lt;/a&gt; documentation, I downloaded the installable and started the process. The installation took a couple minutes on the device I was on and required me to log out and back in. Total install time was less than 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installing-mobsf"&gt;Installing MobSF&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#installing-mobsf" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once logged back in, I fired up the command line. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF"&gt;MobSF README&lt;/a&gt; provides two lines to execute on the command line to pull the latest image. I didn't go through the process of setting up a dymanic analyzer. I didn't think I'd need it (and as luck would have it in this case, I was correct).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the two commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will pull the latest version of MobSF and then run it on port 8000 on the local machine. Once it's running you can access it in your browser by going to &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="find-your-apk"&gt;Find your APK&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#find-your-apk" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theorectically, you'll be running this against an APK you've built and developed. In that case, you'll have the APK handy and can load it into the UI. I, unfortunately, didn't have that luxuary. Fortunately, getting the APK is relatively simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps"&gt;Google Playstore&lt;/a&gt; and search for the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate into the details page of the application (you should see the option to install it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the URL to this page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://apkcombo.com/downloader/"&gt;APKCombo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the URL you copied in step 3 instal the appropriate text box and click "Generate Download Link"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a few seconds, click the download icon next to the link that was generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have the APK to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="using-mobsf"&gt;Using MobSF&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#using-mobsf" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the APK in hand, and MobSF running, navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;. Upload the APK and wait a couple of minutes. If you are watching the logs, you'll see it performing multiple steps behind the scenes. Once it's done analyzing the APK, it'll drop you to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Analyzing an APK" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/mobsf/analyze.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Analyzing an APK with logs" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/mobsf/analyze-logs.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of detail about the APK. Scroll through to see the permissions it's utilizing, certificates attached to it, potential security vulnerabilities, code analysis, detected URLs in the code, hard coded secrets, and strings. All of these would help a team build a better and more secure mobile application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my purpose, this 15 minute excersice not only answered the question I was seeking it also raised a few items that will need to be corrected before the next release. Introducing security practices with a tool like MobSF would be incredibly benefitial to a team tasked with building an Android application. Further, adding in the dynamic analysis capabilities can provide more details on areas to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I didn't need those to answer my question, I'd enourage someone looking to introduce this to a team, to look at the &lt;a href="https://mobsf.github.io/docs/#/dynamic_analyzer"&gt;capabilities of MobSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Data Analysis with Polars Udemy course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/data-analysis-with-polars-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2024-01-29T11:30:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-01-29T11:30:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2024-01-29:/data-analysis-with-polars-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A review of the Udemy course: Data Analysis with Polars&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/learn-analytics-with-polars-review.html"&gt;previous course about Polars&lt;/a&gt;, I was excited to learn more. I settled on &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-polars/"&gt;Data Analysis with Polars&lt;/a&gt; with Liam Brannigan instructing. I was drawn to this because of the mention of visualization using &lt;a href="https://matplotlib.org/"&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"&gt;Seaborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/"&gt;Altair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/"&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt;. The course is billed at 2.5 hours long and is currently going for $85, though I did pick this up during one of Udemy's many sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get started on the review and why I rated it so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have multiple complaints about this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire course is reading from pre-built notebooks or slides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last 26 out of 27 lectures are one page slides. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quizzes in the middle of the courses are not effective, because the course is not designed for the learner to actually do any coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The excercises at the end of lectures are never revisited. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course felt like the instructor was given a bunch of Jupyter notebooks but a more senior instructor and told to go teach the class. There is a lot of reading directly from the notebook, quickly glossing over code, and then talking through the output of the code. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/learn-analytics-with-polars-review.html"&gt;last course&lt;/a&gt;, this one doesn't even feel like a cookbook of usefulness. It's just a glorified slide deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show you what I mean. This is the course list's last 4 sections. I've collapsed them to show only the section header so it's a reasonable sized screenshot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Last 4 sections of the course - 27 lections should take 7 minutes only?" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/polars-course-list-concerns.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 27 lectures in these 4 sections. The total estimated time for these 27 lectures - 7 minutes. There is only 1 video in this entire group of sections. The other 26 out of 27 lectures are one page slides. The slides are "What you'll learn by the end of this lecture" slides and a link to a Jupyter notebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quizzes scattered through out the course are also ineffective. Many of the questioned asked are asking what code provided is correct. These can be helpful, if the learner has done any hands work during the course. But, this course isn't designed that way. It's an instructor reading slides, hand waving at some code, and then executing the code to show it works. It's ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same problem holds true with the excercises at the end of many lectures. They are designed to get the student more experience and I started doing them early in the course. But, they are never revisited. The instructor doesn't talk about them. It's just homework that's assigned as busy work, essentially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid this course. nearly half the course is just a single slide for the lectures. The items I was interested in learning about - visualizations - were among those one page slides. The course is designed like a glorified README, and its not worth the sales price I paid, let along the full price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this entire &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/category/review.html"&gt;Course Reviews&lt;/a&gt; series 7 years ago, with a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/data-analysis-with-pandas-review.html"&gt;post about a Pandas course&lt;/a&gt;. It went so well, I continued both taking various courses to expand my own knowledge and sharing my experiences with those courses here. It seems fitting to look at a Pandas competitors: &lt;a href="https://pola.rs/"&gt;Polars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used Pandas for years and it's done the job well enough. But, Polars is gaining traction in the industry and one of the data engineers at work mentioned it as a possible tool to look at. I like to be informed when my engineers make tooling recommendations, so I took it upon myself to learn a little more about Polars. I did so by selecting a course by Kieran Keene, titled &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unleash-your-polars-python-skills-in-just-2-hours/"&gt;Learn Data Analytics with Polars (Python) in just 2 hours!&lt;/a&gt;. I got this course duing another of Udemy's sales for $13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="about-the-course"&gt;About the course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire course is run out of &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"&gt;Google Colab&lt;/a&gt;. This is nice, because you don't need to set up a virtual environment or install anything to take this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is taught with Polars version &lt;code&gt;0.17.3&lt;/code&gt;, which is from April 2023. I took this course in January 2024, so I used the current version - &lt;code&gt;0.20.2&lt;/code&gt;. This introduces a few very minor deprecations from the older version, but simply reading the deprecation warning for each tells you how to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named, the two deprecations that I recall running into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 0.17 there is the &lt;code&gt;df.apply()&lt;/code&gt; function. This has been deprecated in favor of &lt;code&gt;df.map_rows()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;groupby()&lt;/code&gt; function has been deprecated in favor of &lt;code&gt;group_by()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both take exactly the same arguments, so it was as simple as renaming the instructors function to the modern one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one other minor difference is that the example data has changed at some point between when the course material was recorded and when I took the course. This doesn't change how any of the lectures behave or any of the examples act. It does change a couple results, so I couldn't compare exact numbers between what I received and what the instructor received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not a problem though. The instructor does a very good job of explaining what each lecture is going to teach, shows at least one method of accomplishing the task, and then summarizing the lecture. Through this, it's easy to determine if the results you get with the different sample data returns an accurate result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the short lectures. I believe the longest single lecture is 11 minutes long, but each builds off of what you've done previously. By introducing these natural break points, it's easy to complete a topic and then spend a couple minutes experimenting with other methods or logic to see how the library behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are multiple ways to perform certain tasks, and the instructor takes the time to explain each of these. Building off of one another, it's easy to determine which is appropriate for the scenario being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of scenarios, the course concludes with two short challenges. The goal is to use the knowledge gained from previous lectures to figure out results to two problems. If you followed along through the hour and a half course, these should be pretty easy to figure out but do require combining multiple steps to get to the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this course, the instructor's teaching method, and two challenges at the end to tie the course back to the lectures. This was a very hands on course and the breaks between lectures and sections encouraged experimenting with the library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimenting helps me learn more about the tool, and I commend the instructor for building the course in such a way that students could try out the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found that I liked the Polars library. Pandas has it's quirks and when I dig more into Polars, I'm sure I'll find it has some too. But, Polars feels easier to grasp. The API is easier to understand as you are reading through the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to try out another course to see what else the library can do. That alone should be a complement to both the library and this course - it's encouraged me to keep learning more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a coupon code for Houssem Dellai's &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-github-actions-ci-cd-devops-pipelines/"&gt;Learn Github Actions for CI/CD DevOps Pipelines Course&lt;/a&gt;. I've written about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/setting-up-gitlab-runners.html"&gt;GitLab runners&lt;/a&gt; and the CI/CD process of that tool in the past. I've used &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/find-broken-links-with-github-actions.html"&gt;GitHub actions to check this blog for broken links&lt;/a&gt;. I've used &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-openshift-travisci-and-flask.html"&gt;TravisCI&lt;/a&gt; (and written &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html"&gt;why not to trust TravisCI&lt;/a&gt;). I've used and BitBucket Pipelines in my professional life. I wanted to learn a big more about what GitHub Actions could do and the coupon code made this 4 hour course worth the time to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see below in more detail, but this course was not what I expected. It's advertised as being for "All beginners" and "Ops experts". I argue that both of these are incorrect. This course felt more like a 20-30 lecture "GitHub Actions Cookbook" than a course looking to &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; GitHub actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple formats the instructor uses in this course. It's pretty obvious that the sections in this lecture were recorded independantly. Some lectures take place entirely within the GitHub interface, some are using Powerpoint slides to drive the lecture, one is done on a whiteboard. To me, it seems the various lectures have been bundled together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research - and a mid-lecture "Check out my YouTube" - it's clear why that feeling exists. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HoussemDellai/videos"&gt;lectures are available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of the videos on YouTube are part of this course, but scrolling through, I can quickly see that many of the videos in the course are on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the content of the course, it doesn't match what I was expecting. With the "All beginners" advertisement, I was expecting more discussion and coverage on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; certain things were being done. A discussion on the trade offs or the instructor's through process on how to accomplish tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the content is a lot of "this is my code to accomplish this task". It is a great course to get the quick run down of how to accomplish tasks, especially with Azure. However, it is not a good course if you want to know why a specific block of code is the best route to go. It's a cookbook to accomplish a task. A handful of lectures do cover theory, but these are few and very far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my coupon hadn't knocked off the entire price of the course, I'd be upset with this one. I also picked up two other courses by this instructor and I suspect I'm going to find similar concerns with those courses. Honestly, that's to bad, because the content is good. It's just not marketed how it's packaged. With my expectations set for learning a bit, it's disappointing to get lectures that are designed to be copy and pasted from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't come into this expecting to learn a lot of reasoning behind how things are accomplished. If you need an overview of how to accomplish the tasks in the content list though, you'll find that. It'll be a relatively dry walkthrough of the exact code you need. But, if you want to know why...this isn't the course for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fairly common task an engineer may need to do is to remove all numbers from a list below a threshold. It's a simple enough task that anyone could accomplish - iterate over the list, check the value, if it's below the threshold remove it. With Python you can do this in a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gotcha"&gt;Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's check code for this simple problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;0, 9, 2, 1, 5, 1, 10, 4, 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Deleted'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Kept'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be reasonable to expect an final list that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[9, 5, 10]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the actual output is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[9, 1, 5, 10, 3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;happening&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="explaination"&gt;Explaination&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#explaination" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (unconsious?) assumption that the developer is making with this piece of code is that the final list &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be in &lt;code&gt;numbers_list&lt;/code&gt;. Since we're able to iterate and modify, there is no need for a temporary variable or a need to worry about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-list-copy.html"&gt;list copy gotchas&lt;/a&gt;. But, let's go through this one iteration at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Starting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;]

&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Iteration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;iteration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;---------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;----------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-------------------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;End&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;iteration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this, it's a little clearer what's going on. Let's go through there one iteration at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the first iteration, the value of &lt;code&gt;Index 0&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's deleted. &lt;em&gt;And the problem starts now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the next iteration, the value of &lt;code&gt;Index 1&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;not 9&lt;/strong&gt;). In the previous iteration, &lt;code&gt;Index 0&lt;/code&gt; was deleted, which means everything has moved up one index. The value of &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; was never checked. Instead, we look at a value of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;. It's less than our threshold so it's also deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the third iteration, the value of &lt;code&gt;Index 2&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. Again, we've skipped a value (&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;) and it's never even checked. This iteration doesn't result in a deletion because &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; is not less than &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the forth iteration, the value of &lt;code&gt;Index 3&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. This is deleted as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the fifth iteration, the value of &lt;code&gt;Index 4&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. We've skipped another value (&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;) and this iteration's value is less than our threshold so it's deleted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no further iteration, because the last one has made the final value the last index, so the final value is never checked. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We skipped checking several values because we messed with indexes that were either being operated on or hadn't been operated on yet. This results in unexpected behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick solution is to add the values that exceed our threshold to another variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;larger_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;larger_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;larger_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in the expected list of &lt;code&gt;[9, 5, 10]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution, assuming that the result &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to sit in a variable with the same name, is to use a list comprehension. This does the same thing as above, but keeps the code more compact. It also works because the final result is assigned to a new variable object with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbers_list = [0, 9, 2, 1, 5, 1, 10, 4, 3]
numbers_list = [nums for nums in numbers_list if nums &amp;gt;= 5]
print(numbers_list)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in the expected list of &lt;code&gt;[9, 5, 10]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: List Copy Problems</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-list-copy.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-12-20T15:30:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-12-20T15:30:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-12-20:/python-gotcha-list-copy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Copying a Python list (or any mutable object) isn't as simple as setting one equal to another. Let's discuss a better way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem isn't limited to only &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;s. Any mutable object in Python can be impacted by this "gotcha". The problem is setting one mutable object equal to another doesn't make a copy. It assigns a new variable to the same object as the original. Let's take a look and see how this appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-first-gotcha"&gt;The First Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example is pretty simple. Let's make a copy of our list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list2 = list1
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list1
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list2
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks like I have two lists, both with the same set of values. But, let's modify the second list and change the first element in the list to be &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list2
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt;? It also has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list1
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is occuring because, as mentioned, &lt;code&gt;list2&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to the same object as &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt;. Any change to either, changes the object that both are assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list1 id: {id(list1)}")
list1 id: 1497534800448
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list2 id: {id(list2)}")
list2 id: 1497534800448
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-first-solution"&gt;The First Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be solved a few different ways. The important take away, though, is that you have to create a new object with the original values. I can think of a few ways to handle this. This article doesn't consider performance for these basic lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to utilize the &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method and pass it the initial values from &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list3 = list(list1)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list3
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list3[0] = 0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list3
[0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list1
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list1 id: {id(list1)}")
list1 id: 1497534800448
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list3 id: {id(list3)}")
list3 id: 1497531282368
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second option is to &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; the entire original list into a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list4 = list1[:]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list4
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list4[0] = 0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list4
[0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list1
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list1 id: {id(list1)}")
list1 id: 1497534800448
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list4 id: {id(list4)}")
list4 id: 1497534798208
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; object has a &lt;code&gt;copy()&lt;/code&gt; method that you can utilize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list5 = list1.copy()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list5[0] = 0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list5
[0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list1
[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list1 id: {id(list1)}")
list1 id: 1497534800448
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"list5 id: {id(list5)}")
list5 id: 1497534799552
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each of these three options, you can see that we created new objects because each has a unique object id. Changing one of these copies does not change the original's values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-second-gotcha"&gt;The Second Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, a savvy developer, know all this though. You also have a more advanced data structure. You have a &lt;em&gt;list of lists&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[
    ['first element', 1, 2, 3],
    ['second element', 4, 5, 6],
    ['third element', 7, 8, 9],
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you know about this gotcha, you are going to make a new object and copy the values to the new object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deeplist1 = [
...     ['first element', 1, 2, 3],
...     ['second element', 4, 5, 6],
...     ['third element', 7, 8, 9],
... ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deeplist2 = deeplist1.copy()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"deeplist1 id: {id(deeplist1)}")
deeplist1 id: 1497534571008
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f"deeplist2 id: {id(deeplist2)}")
deeplist2 id: 1497534577536
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with two different objects, is it safe to modify an element in one of the sublists? Turns out, it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deeplist2[0][0] = "NOT 3RD"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deeplist2
[['NOT 3RD', 1, 2, 3], ['second element', 4, 5, 6], ['third element', 7, 8, 9]]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deeplist1
[['NOT 3RD', 1, 2, 3], ['second element', 4, 5, 6], ['third element', 7, 8, 9]]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? The ids of &lt;code&gt;deeplist1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deeplist2&lt;/code&gt; are different. This is true, but the sublists are not. Each sublist is assigned the same object id as the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; id(deeplist1[0][0]), id(deeplist2[0][0])
(1497534796864, 1497534796864)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-second-solution"&gt;The Second Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy"&gt;&lt;code&gt;deepcopy()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method to make a copy of your original object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deeplist3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deepcopy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deeplist1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deeplist3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"NEW VALUE"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deeplist3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'NEW VALUE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'second element'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'third element'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deeplist1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'NOT 3RD'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'second element'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'third element'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;deepcopy()&lt;/code&gt; we can safely make a copy of our list of lists and modify both the original and the copy without impacting the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>A Decade of Fighting Spam</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/decade-fighting-spam-charcoal.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-11-27T15:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-11-27T15:45:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-11-27:/decade-fighting-spam-charcoal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A run down of what a decade of spam fighting looks like on the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcoal is nearing a decade of existance. In January of 2024, the Stack Exchange community will have been fighting the good fight of keeping spam off the platform. I've written about a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;machine being able to flag spam&lt;/a&gt; in the past. I've also posted &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291301/186281"&gt;the original&lt;/a&gt; and it's follow up on being able to &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/307585/186281"&gt;spam flag even better&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Exchange itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was asked to talk a bit about a hobby of mine. I put together this presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A Decade of Fighting Spam by the Stack Exchange community" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-stack-exchange"&gt;What is Stack Exchange?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-stack-exchange" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set a bit of context for those need it. Stack Exchange is a network of over 180 sites covering almost any topic you can think of. It's a question and answer network. The slide you are seeing here are just a handful of the sites of more interesting logos - but you can see they cover a range of topics from &lt;a href="https://workplace.stackexchange.com/"&gt;professional work place questions&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/"&gt;intricacies of the English Language&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Data Science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/"&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A handful of Stack Exchange site logos - Workplace, English Language, Data Science and Arquade included" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by far the largest and most popular is &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. With 24 million questions covering any programming language or framework you have used. It consistently ranks in the top 500 most visited sites on the internet - depending on what service is doing the measuring. Basically, it gets a lot of eyeballs looking at it daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means it's a target for spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The largest Stack Exchange site is Stack Overflow" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide3.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-spam"&gt;What is spam?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network and the community within it settled on a fairly standard definition of spam: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post exists only to promote a product or service and doesn't disclose author's affiliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images here show what the site looks like when the community systems aren't operational. This is the front page of two sites and if you look closely at the time stamps, you'll see that these posts occurred within about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If users - new or experienced - come to the site and see this, they start to turn away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013/2014 this was common. Spam posts would stick around for hours and a group of users decided they could help out across the network by flagging these posts more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Two examples of spam filled front pages on Stack Exchange sites" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide4.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-flagging"&gt;What is flagging?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-flagging" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final bit of context that is needed is: flagging. It's exactly what you'd think it is. The goal of a flag to bring attention to the post by forcing it in the community review queues. This gets more people to look at it. Stack Exchange is built around community moderation. There is very little that elected "Diamond Moderators" need to handle that the community can't handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If enough people flag a post as spam, it's automatically deleted. The community and company decided that getting 6 people to agree a post is spam is an appropriate number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a post is removed as spam, the post is locked, deleted and the author has 100 reputation points removed. These are the visible actions. The reputation hit is to prevent - or slow - a spammer from getting more privileges within the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, a spam post also triggers company checks against future posts matching similar information to the user. These aren't publicly disclosed. But, the company is fairly conservative in terms of blocking users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flagging brings attention to posts for others in the community to see, act upon and eventually remove spam" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide5.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-charcoal"&gt;What is Charcoal?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-charcoal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community hates spam. It's a bad user experience at best to have a page filled with spammy posts. It also makes the site, and community at large, look rather seedy. This isn't great for a community and a company that has built its reputation on accuracy and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcoal was created to watch for spam across the 180+ sites. Actually, when we started it was less than half of that, but over the past decade the network has grown and the anti-spam systems have grown with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has a two phase process to dealing with spam. First is alerting the spam fighting community of potential spam. Users can go cast their flags across the network and deal with it. Second, for the truly egregious spam, the system can utilize the community's flags and automatically cast those flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How's this work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Characoal is the community organization that runs two systems to deal with spam. The first alerts users about potential spam and the second casts flags against detected spam." src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide6.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smokedetector-and-metasmoke"&gt;SmokeDetector and Metasmoke&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#smokedetector-and-metasmoke" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two systems behind this community effort - SmokeDetector and Metasmoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmokeDetector, affectionatly named "Smokey", is designed to be the early warning system. It quickly provides a yes/no decision on whether a post is spam and alerts users for manual action. It passes off the more intense confidence checks and automatic flags to MetaSmoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Two systems create the anti-spam system. SmokeDetector for a quick spam/not-spam decision and Metasmoke to handle confidence checks and automatic flags" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide7.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every post on the network goes through the process below. A user clicks the submit button and Stack Exchange does their few checks - remember these are black boxed - and if the post makes it through these it gets published to a real time web socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmokeDetector does a quick "Is this spam?" check. If it is, it's posted to chat rooms around the network - to the network wide Charcoal room and usually to a site specific room if the room is utilized enough. Users than go and investigate and if they agree that it's spam, cast a flag. After 6 of these are cast, the post is removed. Hooray! Another victory again spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Smokey posts that spam is found, it also sends a message to MetaSmoke. This system is checking how confident we are that this is spam. If there is high confidence, it will start utilizing community member flagging privileges to cast spam flags on the post as well. If there isn't high confidence, no automatic flags will be cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to remove the spammy posts as quickly as possible - and by utilizing automatic flags the number of people that have to go do this manually is reduced. Due to larger community and company discussions and outcomes, the system will not cast all 6 flags except in very very rare circumstances. Someone has to agree with the machines here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A process flow diagram of the Charcoal systems" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide8.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-detect-spam"&gt;How to detect spam&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-detect-spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's spam detection look like? Over the last decade we've tried things like classification schemes, machine learning algorithms, and a handful of AI attempts. But, by far the most reliable has been...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Take a deep breath fellow engineers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each post - goes through thousands of regular expressions. Each expression is weighted based on how likely matching that particular expression means the post is spam. The higher weights are posted into the chatroom kicking off this entire process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Regular Expressions run the world - or at least anti-spam systems on Stack Exchange" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide9.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has built watchlists and blacklists over the decade to help find these posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watchlists are experimental checks. Spam evolves over time. It's actually pretty interesting to watch a dedicated spammer craft their posts to get it to last on the network more than a few minutes. These watchlists are designed to allow the team to test regular expressions without fear of automatically flagging something during testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blacklists are finalized regular expressions that catch spam with a high number of true positives and very low false positives. These the weight spam checkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Stack Exchange itself, the spam fighting community has built tooling that allows work to be done without a high level user to be around. Users can watch for a new regular expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users that aren't trusted just yet, will have their request created as a pull request in GitHub that needs to be approved. Trusted users will get their watchlist automatically added to the system. The same holds true for blacklisted items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Watchlists - Experimental regex detections and Blacklists - Tried and tested regex detection are added by users to fight spam" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide10.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, watchlists and blacklists are only half the problem. The other half is validating that these are accurate. As posts are detected as spam, users provide a signal back to the system on whether a post is a &lt;code&gt;tp&lt;/code&gt; - True Positive - Spam &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a false positive - &lt;code&gt;fp&lt;/code&gt; - not spam. These feedback to the watchlists and will prevent elevating watchlists that are inaccurate to a full blacklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a post has features that the system doesn't detect as spam. In those cases, the community can manually report the post. This triggers the alerts through out the chatrooms so that others can flag it and get it removed. It also allows the community to find potential patterns to watch for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users that aren't trusted yet get pull requests created for their patterns. All of this can be handled and approved within the chatrooms. A lot of this system is built on top of, and keeps most users within, the Stack Exchange ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Community Feedback on the detection reasons is critical to ensuring the system has reliable capabilities" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide11.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the weighted reasons on a detected post. When these are posted in chat, the reasons are also posted as well as the weight of the post. The one on the slide below is particularly bad. Generally anything over about ~225-250 is spam with higher numbers becoming more and more certain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These weights shift over time and as a regular expression is utilized more. This keeps the system flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this particular post, the system determined it was spam and cast three automatic flags from our users. Each user that grants permissions for the system to utilize their flags - because they are responsible for the usage of the flags - can set their threshold for when to allow their name to be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4th flag here came in via a user script the community built, but was not automatically cast. The remaining two flags would have come from the users of the site or from someone that saw the Smoke Detector alert and manually flagged it. Metasmoke doesn't have a record of that because it didn't go through Metasmoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Automatic flags are cast when a post exceeds the threshold set by our users. The system can cast multiple flags from multiple users." src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide12.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="by-the-numbers"&gt;By the numbers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-the-numbers" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmokeDetector has been running since January of 2014. We didn't start recording stats until about 18 months later though, so the dates in the graph start in August 2015. Initially, the system didn't have watch lists, which is why you see the blue and orange lines are pretty close together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around mid 2018/early 2019 we introduced watchlists. This was done because we started seeing persistent spammers. These were spammers that noticed their posts were being deleted quickly and worked to find ways to change the message to stick around longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatrooms are open and based on some messages we have removed, it's obvious the room is watched by the bored spammers. The watchlists reduced the true positives. But because we didn't ever separate the data between blacklists and watchlists the lines began to separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2017, autoflagging was introduced. With autoflagging the system can reduce the time on site for nearly half of the true positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice a major spike in the summer of 2022 and a dip in the summer of 2023. The spike was for a massive spam wave. This was the work of a spammer that had access to a lot of geographically distributed systems - which bypassed Stack Exchange's built in protections - and was a persistent spammer or team of spammers that watched the public chatrooms for changes the spam fighting community made to detect their posts. This went on for 2-3 weeks with thousands of posts being made, adjusted, and deleted. Ultimately, the spammer was blocked at the Stack Exchange level based on heuristics the Charcoal team presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past summer, in 2023, the dip you see is because Stack Exchange experienced a crisis of confidence from the community at large. &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/category/stack-exchange-strike.html"&gt;Moderation work stopped for the months of June and July in protest of the company's policies&lt;/a&gt; toward generative AI on the platform. Charcoal participated in that. While not fully resolved, some of the worst policies were reworked with input from the larger community and work resumed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A graph showing total detections, true positives, and automatic flags over time." src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide13.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Charcoal project is to remove spam quickly from the site. Flags that are cast by the system are tracked and we can clearly see that more automatic flags mean the post is active for less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is no system cast flags, an average spam post lives for 21 minutes on the site. If the system casts all 6 - which is only utilized during a spam wave like in the summer of 2022 and with company permission - a post lives for 16 seconds. During day to day operations, the system is configured to cast 3 automatic flags. This was determined by a lot of conversations with individual sites around the network and what they felt comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Timing of how long a post is visable based on the number of automatic flags. At the default 3 flags, a post will be visible for less than 5 minutes" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide14.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmokeDetector has over 103 thousand commits to its repostory over the last 10 years with 90 different code contributors. In the slide below, the top two graphs show that it's rulesets are updated daily - except for this past summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a 24 hour period, flags are automatically cast from nearly 420 different users around the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the entire goal: over 450,000 spam posts have been identified and deleted by the system and the community in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Daily ruleset updates, 100k+ code commits, 90 contributors, 420 users with automatic flags daily all results in over 450,000 spam posts removed in a decade" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/charcoal-10years/slide15.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have an idea of how one of the largest sites on the internet handles spam. I do want to point out that StackExchange operates very differently from sites like reddit or YouTube or Facebook which spent a lot of company time building their anti-spam systems. Stack Exchange built basic protections themselves and then saw the technical community members step up and take on the challenge. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: Timezone Naive Functions like utcnow() and utcfromtimestamp()</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-timezone-naive-functions.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-11-23T10:15:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-11-23T10:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-11-23:/python-gotcha-timezone-naive-functions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;utcnow() and utcfromtimestamp() don't know about timezones and that causes problems. Let's talk about those, how to fix the problem and their recent deprecation in Python 3.12&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common functions in that are &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#aware-and-naive-objects"&gt;naive datetime objects&lt;/a&gt;. The behind these types of objects is that timezones don't matter. Perhaps you always assume that datetimes are in a set timezone. Or, you are aware of timezones and want to make things easy on yourself so always assume datetimes are set to UTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;utcnow()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;utctimestamp()&lt;/code&gt; functions are naive, but other &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; functions are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-gotcha"&gt;The Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utcfromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1970&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;21600.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was run on a computer in the Central Standard Time time zone. First, I created an object set to the UNIX epoch - Jan. 1, 1970. Since I utilized &lt;code&gt;utcfromtimestamp()&lt;/code&gt; to do this, there is no timezone data attached to this object. When I use the standard &lt;code&gt;timestamp()&lt;/code&gt; function, Python sees there is no timestamp to utilize, so it uses the system configured timezone. Hence the 21,600 second offset from the epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn't always happen though. Sometime &lt;a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81669"&gt;between Python 2 and Python 3 this behavior changed&lt;/a&gt;. This assumption that "no timezone means local timezone" introduced this gotcha. In my opinion isn't a rather dangerous one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize explicit time stamps everywhere. From &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/"&gt;The Zen of Python - PEP 20&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicit is better than implicit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1970&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tzinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that by adding &lt;code&gt;datetime.UTC&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;fromtimestamp()&lt;/code&gt; call, I get a datetime object with &lt;code&gt;tzinfo&lt;/code&gt;. This makes the conversion from the datetime object back into ta timestamp safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way that Python is moving. In an effort to correct these unsafe assumptions that were introduced early in Python 3, the naive datetime functions have been deprecated. If you were to run my first block of code in Python 3.12, you receive a deprecation warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;utcfromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;stdin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DeprecationWarning&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;utcfromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;deprecated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;scheduled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;removal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;aware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;represent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;fromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the message is telling you to add the timezone information and to utilize &lt;code&gt;fromtimestamp()&lt;/code&gt;. In the coming year - years? - both the commonly seen &lt;code&gt;utcnow()&lt;/code&gt; amd &lt;code&gt;utcfromtimestamp()&lt;/code&gt; will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, as someone that has fought this bug in the past, it's a welcome change. Timezone assumptions are difficult to troubleshoot. Assumptions about underlying behavior make it a challenge. Running the same script in different timezones, like you would with a geographicly diverse team, makes it even harder. It's especially annoying if one of your coworkers is utilizing UTC as their time zone so that the script behaves properly for them but no others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have code bases that will need to make this change, but in the end, they will be easier to maintain with the removal of the &lt;code&gt;utc*&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Ruby Gotcha: Operator Precedence</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/ruby-gotcha-operator-precedence.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-10-23T10:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-23T10:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-10-23:/ruby-gotcha-operator-precedence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Ruby you can use either &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my previous roles, the team utilized Ruby. I was not an individual contributor at that point in my career, so my exposure to it was less than much of my team. However, during my tenure, I noticed several "Gotchas" of the Ruby language. Each language has these in their own way, but in this post I'm going to cover one specific one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the difference between &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;? What about the difference between &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-gotcha"&gt;The Gotcha&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-gotcha" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first pass, these two blocks of code appear to do the same thing. Let's take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):003:0&amp;gt; true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; false
=&amp;gt; false
irb(main):004:0&amp;gt; true and false
=&amp;gt; false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the rules of boolean logic, both &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; statements return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):005:0&amp;gt; true || false
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):006:0&amp;gt; true or false
=&amp;gt; true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boolean logic holds true for the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; statements and return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what happens if we assign the result of this to a variable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):007:0&amp;gt; result = true and false
=&amp;gt; false
irb(main):008:0&amp;gt; result1 = true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; false
=&amp;gt; false
irb(main):009:0&amp;gt; result
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):010:0&amp;gt; result1
=&amp;gt; false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we see the problem. With the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; operator, &lt;code&gt;result = true&lt;/code&gt;. With the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator, &lt;code&gt;result1 = false&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operators quickly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):011:0&amp;gt; result2 = true or false
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):012:0&amp;gt; result3 = true || false
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):013:0&amp;gt; result2
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):014:0&amp;gt; result3
=&amp;gt; true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all looks reasonable. But, let's swap the order of our &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):015:0&amp;gt; result2 = false or true
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):016:0&amp;gt; result3 = false || true
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):017:0&amp;gt; result2
=&amp;gt; false
irb(main):018:0&amp;gt; result3
=&amp;gt; true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the differences again, with the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator setting &lt;code&gt;result2 = false&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator setting &lt;code&gt;result3 = true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-going-on"&gt;What is going on?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-going-on" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; are the same thing, but they have different orders of precedence. The (not well formatted in my opinion) documentation shows the &lt;a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/syntax/precedence_rdoc.html"&gt;precedence table for Ruby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key things to point out here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; are above &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, meaning they will be evaluated first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; is also above &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; (but below &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at one of the examples again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):015:0&amp;gt; result2 = false or true
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):017:0&amp;gt; result2
=&amp;gt; false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the order of precedence in mind, this is what happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;result2&lt;/code&gt; is assigned the value of &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; occurs before &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remainder of the statement is evaluated as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was hidden when &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; was swapped because &lt;code&gt;result2&lt;/code&gt; was assigned a value of &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and then the remainder of the statement was also evaluated to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-prevent-this"&gt;How do you prevent this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-you-prevent-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is very few reasons to utilize the English words &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; in Ruby's logical evaluations. Instead, these should be utilized as flow control modifiers (think &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt;) and not for boolean logic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of how it should be utilized for flow control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;': undefined method `/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NilClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NoMethodError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Ruby32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Ruby32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Ruby32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;irb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first example, with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, the statement is broken up like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;numeral = (10 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; numeral) / 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won't work because &lt;code&gt;numeral&lt;/code&gt; doesn't have a value when &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated. Contrast this with the second version where the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigns a value of &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;numeral&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divides &lt;code&gt;numeral&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While basic, it should get the point across. Another example could be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;user = User.find_by_email(email) and user.send_email!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we are only sending an email to the user if we find their information. No information, no email is sent. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: Comparisons</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-comparisons.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-10-18T10:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-18T10:15:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-10-18:/python-gotcha-comparisons.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Comparing two numerical variables in Python can have surprising results if you aren't aware of some common gotchas.

&lt;p&gt;Like every other programming language, Python can't accurately represent floating-point numbers. I'm sure many Computer Science students have lost many hours learning how &lt;a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~eedwards/compsys/float/"&gt;floating representation works&lt;/a&gt;. I remember that class well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, let's get into the problem with comparing &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; values in Python and how to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, me, and anyone with a few years of elementary school under their belt can see that this &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's happening here? We can see the problem by breaking down the component parts of this comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0.3
0.3
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we see the floating point representation that is causing a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="decimal"&gt;Decimal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#decimal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple options, both of which have their drawbacks. Let's start with &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Decimal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decimal module provides support for fast correctly rounded decimal floating point arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds good, but an important gotcha here too is how it handles numerals vs. strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Decimal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'0.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'0.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, to accomplish the comparison above, we need to wrap each of our numbers in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2') == Decimal('0.3')
True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's annoying, but does function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isclose"&gt;isclose&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#isclose" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3.5 implemented &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0485/"&gt;PEP 485&lt;/a&gt; to test for approximate equality. This is done in the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose"&gt;&lt;code&gt;isclose&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isclose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's cleaner than wrapping everything in strings. But, it also is more verbose than a simple &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; statement. It makes your code less clean, but does provide accurate comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-vs"&gt;is vs. ==&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#is-vs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another comparison that I've commonly seen misapplied is developers using &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; when they mean &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;. Put simply, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; should ONLY be used if you are checking if two references refer to the same object. &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; is used to compare value by calling underlying &lt;code&gt;__eq__&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see this in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; c = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = [3, 2, 1]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a == b
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a == c
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a == d
False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, nothing unusual. &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has the same values of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and different values from &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. Now let's use &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b is a
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is c
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is d
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b is c
False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the only &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; statements are the comparison between &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. This is because &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; was initialized with the statement &lt;code&gt;b = a&lt;/code&gt;. The other two variables were initialized as their own statements and values. &lt;strong&gt;Remember, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; compares object references. If they are the same, it returned &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; id(a), id(b), id(c), id(d)
(2267170738432, 2267170738432, 2267170545600, 2267170359040)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are the same object, we get a &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; on their comparison. The others are different, hence the &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nan-nan"&gt;nan == nan&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nan-nan" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt;, or Not a Number, is a floating point value that can not be converted to anything other than a float and is considered not equal to all other values. It's a common way to represent missing values in a data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a key phrase in that description above that is the basis for this Gotcha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is considered not equal to all other values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's common for software to check if two values are equal to one another prior to taking an action. For &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt;, that does not work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; float('nan') == float('nan')
False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prevents code like this from entering the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block of an &lt;code&gt;if/else&lt;/code&gt; statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'nan'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'nan'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;:
...&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;..&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;##&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;
...&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;:
...&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;..&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;##&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, they are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; equal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting, if not unintutive, way of checking if a variable is a &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt; value. Since &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt; is not equal to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other values, it is not equal to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a != a
True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, "Interesting". But, when your code is looked at by others it's also "confusing". There is an easier way to show that you are checking for a &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt; value. &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isnan"&gt;&lt;code&gt;isnan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'nan'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'infinity'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isnan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isnan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isnan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, that's a much clearer check that we want to see if the value is &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt;. It's likely you aren't just passing &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt; to a single variable. You're probably using a library like &lt;a href="https://numpy.org/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, you have functions in each of those libraries that can check for &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt; in a performant way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In NumPy the function has the same name but in the NumPy library: &lt;code&gt;numpy.isnan(value)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Pandas, the function has a slightly different name: &lt;code&gt;pandas.isna(value)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparisons aren't always as straight forward as we'd like. I covered a few common comparison problems in Python here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floating point comparisons are common across languages. Python has a few ways of making this easier for developers. I recommend utilizing &lt;code&gt;isclose&lt;/code&gt; as it keeps the code a bit cleaner and eliminates the need to wrap numbers in strings if using the &lt;code&gt;Decimal&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; should &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; being used to check if two items are referring to the same object. In any other case, it's not doing the check you want it to be doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt; is equal to &lt;em&gt;nothing else&lt;/em&gt;. It's important to be aware of that before you start comparing values in your dataset to one another. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: Join vs Concat</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-join-vs-concat.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-10-12T10:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-12T10:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-10-12:/python-gotcha-join-vs-concat.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Append 100,000 strings together using join or concat - Which is faster?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a somewhat contrivied example to demonstrate a problem. I need to create a string with the word &lt;code&gt;word&lt;/code&gt; 100,000 times. What's the fastest way to generate this string? I could use string concatenation (simply &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; the strings to one another). I could &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join"&gt;&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a list with 100,000 items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposed code for this example is below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;concat_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;Â  Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;final_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;Â  Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;Â  Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;Â  Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;final_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;concat_string&lt;/code&gt;, I iterate 100,000 items with each iteration adding my &lt;code&gt;word&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the string. In &lt;code&gt;join_string&lt;/code&gt;, I append my &lt;code&gt;word&lt;/code&gt; to a list on each iteration and then join the list into a string at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running each function through the built in profiler (&lt;code&gt;cProfile&lt;/code&gt;) shows how these two functions perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cProfile.run('concat_string("word ")')

&lt;h2 id="whats-happening-here"&gt;What's happening here?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-happening-here" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; is more than 75x than the concatination method. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;String are immutable objects in Python. I talked about these in my last &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-optional-default-arguments.html"&gt;Gotcha Article about default parameters&lt;/a&gt;. This immutability means that a string can't be changed. &lt;code&gt;concat_string&lt;/code&gt; does appear to be changing the string with each &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; action, but under the hood, Python has to create a new string object each iteration through the loop. That means there are 99,999 temporary string values - creating and discarding almost all of them immediately on the next iteration during the concatenation action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;join_string&lt;/code&gt; on the other hand, is appending 100,000 string objects to a list. But, only one list is created. The final &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; is only doing a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; concatenation with all 100,000 strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-implications-of-this"&gt;What are the implications of this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-implications-of-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a contrived example to show the problem, there are real performance impacts to string immutability that may not be obvious. There are other places where a new string is created commonly used in Python. A couple examples are &lt;code&gt;f-strings&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; format specifiers and &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt;. Each of these create a brand new string. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you should avoid these, as the performance impact is only really obvious in situations where you are appending &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of strings together. However, if you have a string formatting line in a loop, it's a potential area to focus on for performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Python Gotcha: Mutable Default Optional Arguments</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-optional-default-arguments.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-10-06T10:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-06T10:15:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-10-06:/python-gotcha-optional-default-arguments.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick walk through of why mutable defaults on optional arguments is bad in Python.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without running this in your IDE, what does the following code output? Forgive the use of &lt;code&gt;vins&lt;/code&gt;, I work in the logistics field and deal with vehicle identification numbers frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def add_vin(this_vin: str, vins: list = []):
    if this_vin not in vins:
        vins.append(this_vin)
    return vins

add_vin("VIN1")
add_vin("VIN2")
print(add_vin("VIN3"))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably saw that &lt;code&gt;vins&lt;/code&gt; is an optional argument and that it defaults to an empty list. Run this function three times without passing it a list to append to, and it's reasonable to assume that you have a final result of a list with a single item contained in it - &lt;code&gt;VIN3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that's wrong. The output is actually &lt;code&gt;["VIN1", "VIN2", "VIN3"]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-going-on"&gt;What's going on?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-going-on" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, default arguments are bound to a function at the time the function is defined. This is only done once. If you don't pass the optional argument in to the function call, the same list is changed when the function is called. This means that in the example above, a new list is not created each time the function is called without the optional &lt;code&gt;vins&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see this by slightly modifying the code above to show the object ID we are operating on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def add_vin(this_vin, vins=[]):
    if this_vin not in vins:
        print(f"id={id(vins)}")    # Print the object ID we are appending to
        vins.append(this_vin)
    return vins
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which outputs the following as it adds each VIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;id=2954990867712
id=2954990867712
id=2954990867712
['VIN1', 'VIN2', 'VIN3']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time &lt;code&gt;add_vin&lt;/code&gt; was called without passing it a list to operate on, the function will operate on the same default list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="another-example"&gt;Another example&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#another-example" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example above is basic, but gets the point across. However, let's look at something a bit more common. Connecting to a database with a connection object at the parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open_database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;make_connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'example.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do database things with `connection`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done. You've closed your connection. Your DBA will thank you. However, what happens next time you call &lt;code&gt;open_database()&lt;/code&gt; in your code? After all, your connection information is there by default, you don't need to pass a new connection, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, wrong. You've closed the &lt;code&gt;connection&lt;/code&gt; and it's the default argument. The next call to &lt;code&gt;open_database&lt;/code&gt; will utilize the same &lt;code&gt;connection&lt;/code&gt; object. A connection that is closed. Your database call will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="last-example"&gt;Last Example&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#last-example" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to print the current datetime, sleep for 10 seconds, and print the new datetime - right?! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;06&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;21.392973&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;06&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;21.392973&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, an optional default argument is only bound once. Since a new value isn't passed to the function on the second call, the exact same value is used the second time through. Whoops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-about-this"&gt;What can I do about this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-i-do-about-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best option, in my opinion, is to set the default values to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. This is going to make it very obvious that there is a problem. In the first example, you'll get an exception because you can't append to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. In the second, your database calls will error because &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; doesn't contain connection information. In the third, you'll print &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; instead of an expected &lt;code&gt;datatime&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could pass an immutable object like a tuple or a frozenset, but even these have caveats to be aware of. For example, a tuple can contain something mutable in it (ie. a list). Personally, I prefer to utilize &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Syncing Obsidian Notes across devices using Git and GitLab</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/obsidian-gitlab-setup.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-09-26T13:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-09-26T13:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-09-26:/obsidian-gitlab-setup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Setting up Obsidian to sync notes across devices utilizing git and a GitLab backend&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a lot of notes. About five years ago I switched from utilizing notebooks, because I was going through them so quickly, to a 
&lt;a href="https://getrocketbook.com/"&gt;Rocket Book&lt;/a&gt;. This feels very similar to a notebook, with the benefit that it is reusable. It also has an application that allows me to quickly 
scan a page and save it to one of several locations. It's very handy. The downside is that the OCR isn't perfect (oooor, my handwriting is bad) and the
annoyance of cleaning the pages every week or so. I've found that if I don't let the pages dry completely, then the next time I go to use that page it 
has a fine film over it that makes writing a little more difficult. Think writing with a pen that is low on ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href="https://getrocketbook.com/"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; a while ago. I've put a little bit of effort into utilizing it, but more recently I've committed to utilizing it more.
The idea of all digial notes is enticing. Over time I'll see if it's helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, like anyone with multiple devices, I want my Obsidian vault on all devices. What if I have a thought while I'm away from my main computer? One option is to utilize the &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/sync"&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/a&gt; feature. It's got end to end encryption, version history and a monthly subscription fee. I can build something using my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html"&gt;existing GitLab installation&lt;/a&gt; without that monthly subscription fee. Plus, since I'm the only user of this, I'm ok with a little trade off that a full service provides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="repository-setup"&gt;Repository Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#repository-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gitlab"&gt;GitLab&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gitlab" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within GitLab set up a new project by clicking on "New Project" in the upper right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Create a new GitLab Project" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/new_gitlab_project.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the option to create a new blank project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Create a blank repository" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/blank_gitlab_project.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to set up the project details. Select a name that is meaningful for you. I've utilized &lt;code&gt;andy-notes&lt;/code&gt; in the screenshot below. I also created this without a &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt;, because I'll generate the initial repository in a moment and push it up to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New project details - without a precreated README" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/project_details.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="repository-initialization"&gt;Repository Initialization&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#repository-initialization" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of steps only has to occur once. All devices will be able to start with the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the command prompt or terminal (depending on what your operating system calls the system console). Navigate to the location you want your notes to be stored. In my case, I created a new directory to match the name of my repository. I then created a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; with the following content in the directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;app.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;appearance.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;community-plugins.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;core-plugins.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;graph.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.obsidian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;hotkeys.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should ignore the majority of the &lt;code&gt;.obsidian&lt;/code&gt; hidden directory between my devices, but keep a few key items. I may update this over time, but for now this is working well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, initialize the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd andy-notes
git init --initial-branch=main
git remote add origin git@&amp;lt;my.server.url&amp;gt;:andy/andy-notes.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push --set-upstream origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're ready to start utilizing Obsidian and GitLab!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obsidian-setup"&gt;Obsidian Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#obsidian-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="first-open"&gt;First Open&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#first-open" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the backend repository is set up and it's been initially configured, all instances of Obsidian can utilize these sets of steps to start working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is not the device you initilized the repository on, you need to perform an initial &lt;code&gt;pull&lt;/code&gt; of the repository to this device so that it is a local folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@&amp;lt;my.server.url&amp;gt;:andy/andy-notes.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Obsidian. Since this is the first time you are opening it, you'll be asked to select where your vault is stored. You want to select the "Open folder as vault" option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Open an existing folder as your vault" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/open_folder.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the location that your repository has been cloned into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="enable-plugins"&gt;Enable Plugins&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#enable-plugins" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has support for &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins"&gt;community built plugins&lt;/a&gt;. There are plugins to do all kinds of things to improve your writing and note taking. I encourage the reader to look through or search for plugins that may help you. We, however, need one specific one to accomplish our goal of syncing the vault over to GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git"&gt;Obsidian Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install community plugins we need to enable this feature. In the lower left of the workspace, click the gears icon. Then click on "Community plugins", and finally "Turn on community plugins"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Enable Community Plugins" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/enable_plugins.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this enabled, you can now browse the community plugins. To do so, click the browse button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Browse community plugins button" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/browse_plugins.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &lt;code&gt;Obsidian Git&lt;/code&gt;. While writing this, it was the first result. You should be looking for the one by Vinzent. Click on the card to pull up plugin details and potential actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Obsidian Git in the Community Plugins marketplace" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/plugin_search.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then click "Install". The installation process should only take a moment or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Install the Obsidian Git plugin by clicking the install button" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/plugin_install.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll receive a confirmation in the upper right if the install is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Successful plugin install confirmation message" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/plugin_install_success.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, enable the new plugin. The previous "install" button has changed to be "Enable". Click that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Enable new Obsidian Git plugin" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/plugin_enable.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="configure-obsidian-git"&gt;Configure Obsidian Git&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#configure-obsidian-git" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Obsidian Git plugin installed, it's time to configure it. There are a few quick settings to fill out. First, you need to click the "Options" button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Obsidian Git plugin configuration options" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/plugin_options.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first setting to change is how often you want the backup to GitLab to occur. This automatic back up is disabled by default. I set mine to be every 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Adjust the backup interval" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/backup_interval.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, enable &lt;code&gt;Pull updates on startup&lt;/code&gt; so that the instance of Obsidian that is running is always up to date. Your notes from other devices will be synchronized when Obsidian launches and you can get right back to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Enable pull updates on startup with this toggle" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/pull_startup.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to add the Author name and email address. This is the information that will be sent on each commit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Commit Author information" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/commit_author.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also adjusted the autocommit message to include the hostname of the device performing the commit. I have been going back and forth on whether this is important enough for me to keep since I'm the only one that utilizes this vault. But, if you want to adjust the messages there are two instances where the commit message can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding the hostname to the automatically generated commit messages" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/commit_author.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After performing the steps above, this instance of Obsidian is ready to utilize GitLab to sync your vault for free. Each new instance only needs to have the Obsidian Git plugin installed, enabled and configured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've configured your instance, when you open Obsidian the plugin will pull changes from the repository and let you know that everything has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Obsidian successfully updated the vault after opening" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/open_success.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on a scheduled basis - 5 minutes in my case - it will commit and push changes to GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Successful autocommit" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/autocommit.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GitLab, this commit will should show up immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GitLab commit" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/obsidian/commit.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have Obsidian set up on my main devices. I've enjoyed the ability to have my notes available as soon as I open the application. Overall, this was pretty easy to set up. It seems like a lot of steps, but the one time setup makes it much longer than installing and configuring a plugin for each new instance actually takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to keep my notes digital and I'm hopeful that this new set up will help. I can move between computers for personal projects instead of wondering what I had found in my research because I left it on another tab on another machine and forgot to put it with the rest of my notes. Now, it just happens. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="gitlab"/></entry><entry><title>How to disable Grafana in Gitlab 16.3 Omnibus</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/disable-grafana-in-gitlab-16.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-08-23T22:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-08-23:/disable-grafana-in-gitlab-16.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;GitLab 16.3 deprecated and disabled the bundled Grafana, but didn't provide complete instructions for how to disable it. Fortunately, it's easy to do. I've documented the few steps needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to love my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html"&gt;self hosted instance of GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. I look forward to the 22nd of every month to pull down the 
newest dot update and enjoy the new features. As with any piece of software, things get deprecated and eventually disabled over
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 16.3 - released in August 2023 - the version of &lt;a href="https://grafana.com/"&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt; bundled with the self hosted version of GitLab reached the 
end of it's depreciation window and was disabled. GitLab added a check to prevent an update if it was still enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="symptom"&gt;Symptom&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#symptom" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performing an &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; update, GitLab 16.3 will error out if Grafana is still enabled on your instance. The error looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Preparing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unpack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ee_16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.3.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_amd64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#deprecation"&gt;documentation linked&lt;/a&gt; provides four steps to follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To switch away from bundled Grafana to a newer version of Grafana from Grafana Labs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a version of Grafana from Grafana Labs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the existing dashboards from bundled Grafana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import the existing dashboards in the new Grafana instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#integrate-with-gitlab-ui"&gt;Configure GitLab&lt;/a&gt; to use the new Grafana instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've removed the links in steps 2 and 3, because they really don't matter for this write up. Step 1 does not have a link, so it's left as 
and excercise to the user to install Grafana in their environment. Step 4, links to another article that provides a few more steps to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the left sidebar, expand the top-most chevron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Admin Area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the left sidebar, select Settings &amp;gt; Metrics and profiling and expand Metrics - Grafana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Add a link to Grafana checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the Grafana URL. Enter the full URL of the Grafana instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Save changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. That's the set of instructions provided by GitLab. Follow those, rerun your &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; update and you'll run into the same symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missing step is hinted at in the error message itself: &lt;code&gt;grafana[enable] has been deprecated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a setting in the GitLab configuration file. You will need to edit the config file and set the value to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb&lt;/code&gt; (or appropriate path) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;grafana[enable]&lt;/code&gt; value to be &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. On my config this was on line 1689, but I recommend you search for the string &lt;code&gt;grafana&lt;/code&gt; to find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grafana['enable'] = false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconfigure GitLab by running &lt;code&gt;gitlab-ctl reconfigure&lt;/code&gt;. Let this run and it should end with &lt;code&gt;gitlab Reconfigured!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now resume the &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; update that failed due to having Grafana enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done, you will get the standard GitLab upgrade complete message and you'll be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reading-unsupported-config-value-grafana"&gt;Reading unsupported config value grafana.&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reading-unsupported-config-value-grafana" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: July 2024, GitLab 17.1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GitLab 17.1 update from June 2024, Grafana has been completely removed. If you still have &lt;code&gt;grafana&lt;/code&gt; keys in the config file upon updating to 17.1, the upgrade will fail with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mixlib::config::unknownconfigoptionerror: Reading unsupported config value grafana.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this is to edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb&lt;/code&gt; and comment out (or remove entirely) all lines that start with &lt;code&gt;grafana&lt;/code&gt;. Once this is done, save the file and attempt the upgrade again. Like when it was originally deprecated, this step will end with &lt;code&gt;gitlab Reconfigured&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="gitlab"/></entry><entry><title>Failure of Management - Unlimited PTO</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/management-failure-unlimited-pto.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-08-14T15:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-14T15:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-08-14:/management-failure-unlimited-pto.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unlimited PTO is a perk more and more organization are offering their employees. Unfortunately, many managers and organization are managing this poorly and failing their employees. What does this management failure look like?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="the-pitch"&gt;The pitch&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-pitch" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlimited PTO - more vacation time! - is a great recruiting pitch. Who wouldn't want to take more time off through out the year? Recruiters like
unlimited PTO because it reduces benefit package negotiations over vacation time. Theorectically, it should help fight employee burn out too because 
employees can take time off to recharge any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an employer perspective it also has benefits. A defined vacation package requires employers to payout unused time if an employee leaves the 
company. The Wall Street Journal, in March 2015, reported that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-ATWORKB-2313"&gt;this cost employers of less than 500 workers approximately $1,900 per employee&lt;/a&gt;. 
For employers of over 500 workers, this jumped to over $2,600 per employee. Unlimited PTO isn't accrued, so the company doesn't owe this payout if 
the employee leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-downsides"&gt;The downsides&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-downsides" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlimited" doesn't truely mean "unlimited". An employee isn't going to get 6 months of vacation approved by management. A 
&lt;a href="https://blog.namely.com/does-your-pto-plan-type-even-really-matter/"&gt;survey conducted by Namely&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 showed that employees that were offered unlimited PTO took as many &lt;em&gt;or fewer&lt;/em&gt; days of vacation time
compared to peers at companies with a defined number of PTO days. On average, this survey showed that US employees are taking about 12 days a year off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another downside, is management failure to implement unlimited PTO fairly. I recently read a story of a worker that had been denied a two week vacation 
this summer that they requested in May to take place in August. Other than a day off for an illness earlier in the year, they hadn't taken time off in 2023. However, a team mate had just come back from a two week vacation and had taken another two week vacation over the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company is exposing themselves to a potential &lt;a href="https://www.schaeferhalleen.com/leave-discrimination-workplace/"&gt;leave discrimination&lt;/a&gt; claim. According to what I've been told, it sounds like one employee 
is allowed to take a leave but others are not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the jobs of a manager of teams is to prevent to many overlapping vacations. With an unlimited policy, how do you justify allowing one person
time off and not another? Worse, how do you justify a month of time off for one employee and only one day for another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flip side of this is how a manager determines when abuse occurs. Is a month of PTO in a year abuse? Two months? Two weeks? Where is that line and
once defined how do you continue to present this as "unlimited"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alternatives"&gt;Alternatives&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#alternatives" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked at companies that have "unlimited PTO", a set number of days of PTO and "minimium number of days of PTO". Personally, I prefer the last two.
Unlimited PTO - as an employee - very quickly becomes a game of determining how much is to much, and stressing out about having time off denied over a 
vague policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set number of days is nice because you know exactly how much time to take. Management, in my experience, has been way less picky about time off in 
these environments because once you hit that number of days, you are done taking time off. The trade off here is that unused time either has to be 
rolled over to the following year (company policy may prevent this) or extended vacations start cropping up at the end of the year. As an employee, I had
several month long end of the year vacations, which worked out nicely for me. From a project planning perspective though, this means that those time 
periods mean that work slows to a crawl. Company culture has to allow for this and fortunately, it did in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last option is, essentially setting a minimium and maximium number of days to take off. This isn't &lt;em&gt;quiet&lt;/em&gt; "unlimited", but in my experience was 
labeled that with an asterisk. The important part though is that the company required you to take a minimium amount of time off and it had to be in
blocks of time, not one off days. This encourages downtime and better work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-thoughts-on-unlimited-pto"&gt;My thoughts on unlimited PTO&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-thoughts-on-unlimited-pto" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left a company with a well defined PTO policy that granted more time with more seniority. I left this company to join one with unlimited PTO. At the
time I thought that I'd be using more time off and enjoying the benefits of this unlimited PTO policy. Unfortunately, like many others, didn't do that.
Instead I took fewer days than my defined policy had allowed and even lost some company holidays that the previous employeer had that the new one did 
not. In short, I worked more. It took a long time and a lot of push back within the company to get people to take the time they needed to recharge. 
Sadly, by the time I left that role, it was still uncommon for people to take extended vacations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlimited PTO is as much a benefit as it is a company culture thing. During interviews, applicants should be asking questions about how much time their
potential coworkers are taking off. Are these truly times off or are they expected to be able to take a phone call? These answers will help them 
determining if "unlimited PTO" is a benefit the company offers or recruiting buzzwords put in place to lure in new employees and it's 
actually &lt;a href="https://www.facet.net/posts/why-we-ditched-our-unlimited-vacation-plan"&gt;a scam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job"/><category term="meta"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - The strike is over</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-ends.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-08-07T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-07T12:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-08-07:/stackexchange-moderator-ends.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are done striking. What did two months of inaction on the part of curators achieve?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/392032/186281"&gt;The Stack Exchange strike is over&lt;/a&gt;. It took two months and two days of inaction on behalf of community members and moderators to resolve
the strike. The &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/391847/186281"&gt;results of the negotiations&lt;/a&gt; were posted last week. Over the weekend the community voted that the goals of the strike have
been achieved and called the end the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was achieved? What did more than two months of community upheaval get the users of Stack Exchange? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ai-generated-posts"&gt;AI Generated Posts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ai-generated-posts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective immediately, Stack Exchange has agreed to allow the removal of content based on a combination of strong and weak indicators of GPT 
usage. Additionally, the original policy that was the straw that started all of this has been both &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/391626/186281"&gt;publicly released&lt;/a&gt; and declared invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release took two months and was the cause of the strike beginning. It drove a wedge between the moderators of Stack Exchange and the 
company and its employees. I do not understand why it took so long to release this. The public answer is that there was initial moderator 
pushback on releasing it but that was recinded within days. Like much of the public communications during this, Stack Exchange clung to 
outdated information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I think is amazing is that this private policy was never leaked in full during the strike. Despite what the company was saying about
moderators and the community, the community abided by its believe that agreements - private moderator space - should remain just that: private. I 
applaud the moderation community for this commitment to their ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-dumps"&gt;Data Dumps&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#data-dumps" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Dumps were turned off back in March. They were re-enabled several weeks into the strike as one of the first concessions. However, it's 
important to note that a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/391640/186281"&gt;former employee has presented that this was not an unwavering commitment&lt;/a&gt;. They had been contacted by the Stack
Exchange CEO in March to disable the scheduled data dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company officially states that it's committed to the  long-term (foreseeable future) survival of the data dumps, the API, and SEDE [Stack Exchange Data Explorer]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good. It is concerned that this action was done without informing the community and only discovered after the after though. This type of 
"ask for forgiveness" behavior from Stack Exchange is common and is a concern for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moderation-agreement-changes"&gt;Moderation Agreement Changes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#moderation-agreement-changes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange agreed to a review period for binding policy changes and policies must be made public. This is another big one that caused the strike
to move forward. I'm happy to see this has been resolved in a way that benefits the community and transparency. Time will tell if this holds true, as 
it's only something that we can say is effective until it is no longer effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the agreement holds though, a review period will be good for the moderators that are expected to enforce changes. It will give them
time to get clarifications and be prepared for the discussions on meta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also agreed to update their press policy. New statements to the press must get at least one member of the community management team to 
sign off on the statement and statements must be as general as possible. This works in tandum with the existing policy put in place in 2019, where
statements won't discuss an individual moderator without written permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another one that we can't judge effectiveness of until it's been broken. Unfortunately, the press policy from 2019 wasn't enough to prevent
some statements to the press this time that presented moderators in very unflattering light. Even though none were identified by name, the broad 
statements were taken out of context in a couple instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there was an &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/391990/186281"&gt;apology&lt;/a&gt; for that from the Vice President of Community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my most sincere personal apologies to mods who felt that in our previous text we were accusing them of racism. While that was not the intent of the text that I wrote (nor did that sentiment reflect the feelings of anyone involved in drafting the text), I can understand how it could be read that way, and I regret that we allowed it to be published like that. You have my sincere apologies, which I will also deliver in person at the upcoming mod/staff meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="violations-of-the-moderator-agreement"&gt;Violations of the Moderator Agreement&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#violations-of-the-moderator-agreement" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current moderator agreement does not layout a process for determining if the company violates the agreement. The strike representatives and the 
company agreed to an outline for such a process. IF Stack Exchange is found to have violated the agreement, actions taken and comments made during the 
violation must be retracted and nullified and a public apology must be made detailing the violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one that I hope we don't have to see utilized. Again, time will tell if it is something that will occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a process where the moderation team can vote on if a violation occurred. Exact numbers of still being determined, but essentially a 
minimium number of moderators must vote on if a violation was committed and from that a minimium amount must vote that a violation occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm unhappy with the percentages used as placeholders, the discussions here continue. I am happy with the process and the proposed actions if 
a violation is determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stack-exchange-processes"&gt;Stack Exchange Processes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#stack-exchange-processes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several internal changes were negotated as well. Each of these were around how the company communicates. These include being transparent that the 
strike occurred, collaboration with the community instead of fighting it, public policies, and clear communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are positives changes and can only be evaluated over time. There are already signs that some are taking place with public releases of 
policies, acknowledgement of the agreement itself and discussions around the final details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-do-i-think"&gt;What do I think?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-i-think" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty pessimistic of the last two months. Stack Exchange appeared to be following reddit's footsteps in some cases. I was afraid that
the company would start replacing moderators in a few months - either when the automated systems started flagging inactivity or when the products 
announced at the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-overflowai-reaction.html"&gt;developer conference last month&lt;/a&gt; started appearing on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still pessimistic about the future of the platform, if I'm being honest with myself. I do not think generative AI will be a benefit to the community,
as it exists right now. By the time it's to a point where generative AI doesn't make things up, it'll be to late. The bad data and information will 
already been on the site and trust will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies that can't be measured until a violation occurs also has me concerned. We went through this cycle back in 2019 with a strike being 
very narrowly averted then. Unfortunately, the same things that occurred then triggered the issues now: a private policy and talking to the press. Both
were supposed to be resolved then. Both are supposed to be resolved now. Unfortunately, we won't know if that's the case until the policies cause another
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...am I sticking around as a moderator? There is a virtual moderator meet up later this month with the CEO of Stack Exchange. I think that will be
when I make my final determination. However, two months of not moderating was a welcome break. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - Community and AI Talk Reaction</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-overflowai-reaction.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-07-27T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-07-27T12:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-07-27:/stackexchange-moderator-strike-overflowai-reaction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really was trying not to post anything about the strike again until it was resolved. There was a long period of no action in July so my 
assumption was that it was being worked on behind the scenes with the company and the designated representatives. Turns out, that it was just
quiet for a couple weeks with no movement. One important development was the release (finally) of the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/391626/186281"&gt;private policy on GPT Generators&lt;/a&gt;. This
is significantly different from the one that was released publicly and was part of the cause of the current moderator strike. The community's 
response to this policy was as expected - suprise at how bad the policy was even with moderators saying it was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Prashanth Chandrasekar - CEO of Stack Overflow - presented the next vision for Stack Exchange. The presentation is available on 
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5F5t205pYA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. It starts around the 9 minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reaction"&gt;Reaction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reaction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="welcoming"&gt;Welcoming&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#welcoming" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will continue to be the focus. 100%. We are here to serve you. To fight on your behalf. To make sure you are recognized for the work you are doing and that you are able to responsible harness the power of AI for your needs to be the best devolopers you can be. All of this is centered around the collective community and knowledge. That is irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good start. It rings hollow to me right now though. These last two months in particular have shown that the community is easily tossed aside. 
2019, and it's literal legal settlement with a community member for tossing them aside, shows that current time isn't a one time thing. We'll see what the rest of this talk covers, but right now this feels like pandering to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="guiding-principles"&gt;Guiding Principles&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#guiding-principles" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find new ways to give technologists more time to create amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good. I'm all about efficiency for myself and my teams. If we can make developers' and engineers' lives easier, that's a win for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accuracy is fundamental. That comes from attributed, peer-reviewed sources that provide transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler - I received a sneak peak of a portion of this presentation two days before the official one in Berlin. The information that will be shown 
later in the presentation will cover some of this. It doesn't address all of it though. I'm pleased with the attribution aspect of this. 
Stack Overflow content is &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing"&gt;licensed under CC-by-SA&lt;/a&gt;. Attribution is required and I approve of any effort to improve that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm concerned about accuracy. Their own test of the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-does-stackexchange-care.html"&gt;GenAI powered formatting assistant&lt;/a&gt; last month showed this is a problem. 
Current GenAI - Chat GPT, Bard, etc - are well known for making information up instead of saying "I don't know". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology field should be accessible to all, including beginners to advanced users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird ending phrase, but I agree. Technology fields are not limited to engineers, software developers and people with the desire to learn how to 
program. Technological improvements should come from any one who wants to make life easier. AI can and will help with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans should always be included in the application of any new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, agreed. My concern here is whether or not Stack Exchange has the capability to do that. Technically, they've had a human involved, but it's 
only been from a single perspective - that over the company. They have ignored the other side of this: the community. The people that provided the 
data for their business to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="overflow-ai"&gt;Overflow AI&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#overflow-ai" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;insert applause&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been in development for "the past three months". It also covers 6 items being talked about today and 6 additional items. That time frame is 
concerning. Three months is not a lot of time to build a lot of these larger items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search: Summarized verion of multiple answers with citations from where the answers came from. It also allows you to continue the conversation with the 
results - including code. It also allows the user to post the question to Stack Overflow if the generative AI portion gets stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concerns lie with how this impacts the community. Hand waving away that the system is able to synthesize an answer and properly attribute it, what
happens next? Stack Overflow has a reputation - deserved or not is up to the reader - for being harsh on new users that don't "try". If a new user 
comes and gets an answer without posting the question that's wonderful for the user. They move on and complete what they need to complete. For the 
community, though, we have a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it unlikely that a new user is going to post a question to Stack Overflow when they received an answer. Why would they? They already got the 
answer they need. If this repeats constantly, the knowledge base that Stack Overflow represents becomes significantly less useful. Fewer questions
mean fewer answers. With fewer answers, the platform becomes more dependant on the trained AI model which is receiving less data to feed it. The system
spirals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this only matter to prevent duplicates though? If the system is only summarizing other topics, wouldn't that mean the question being asked is a 
duplicate? I don't think that's the case. I think with the "continue discussion" portion of this, Stack Overflow will be losing out on better written
and described problems. Problems with more detail that the community could benefit from seeing and answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Visual Studio plugin looks interesting. I don't think it's adding much that other plugins can't do already, other than providing a first party 
integration to Stack Overflow. The same is true for the Slack / Stack Overflow integration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise knowledge injestion is an interesting product. While we don't use Stack Overflow for teams at my current company, this would be 
a great way to start using it. The ability to load initial data into a new system is important. I'd love to see this in practice and how well it does 
at building initial Q&amp;amp;A pairs from the data it injests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked into Stack Overflow for Teams for my profession work. A couple comments that were made do raise a few concerns about how Stack Exchange
is using company data. Before making a recommendation to utilize it for my company, I'd need to investigate that data from my company is not made 
available outside of my organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, discussions. Stack Exchange is adding a forum to their collectives product. The community has spent over a decade to not be a forum. This change
is not great in my opinion. Forums, social media, are a different beast than Stack Overflow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned about the direction Stack Exchange is taking and the employee resources they are using to go that route. Engagement, page views, and 
traffic has been a huge underlying concern at Stack Exchange for a while. It was particularly noticed when ChatGPT was released and with the comments 
about driving users away. However, this downward trend has been ongoing for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think GenAI is going to solve this problem. I think it will improve new user experience, but the way this has been presented it will be to the
detriment of the larger community. Fewer questions will exist to answer and that will slowly cause users to disengage from the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the opening of the talk feels like lip service to the community to me. These changes are designed to put a barrier between users of the 
community. Even the discussions product has the barrier. Discussions will only be available in Collectives, not to the general community. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>What should a software engineering interview look like?</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/ideal-engineering-interviews.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-07-06T15:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-07-06T15:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-07-06:/ideal-engineering-interviews.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've interviewed a lot of engineers at various stages in their careers.

&lt;h2 id="some-context"&gt;Some context&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#some-context" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent nearly five years at PacketFabric. In my role as Vice President of Software Engineering at the company, I rebuilt the hiring pipeline for
the software engineering organization. As the company closed it's Series B round of funding we needed to bring on world class talent quickly.  I moved
on to Woven Teams for a short stint as Director of Engineering where I not only built a tool used by thousands of engineers to get a new job, I hired
for members of my team as well. In my current role at FleetOps, I've been working to ensure this previous experience is utilized to build a 
candidate focused hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote about my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/looking-for-new-role.html"&gt;hunt for a new role in the summer of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. This covered my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/what-job-source-uses-which-ats.html"&gt;experiences with various application tracking systems (ATS)&lt;/a&gt;, 
which &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/upload-resume-reenter-resume.html"&gt;application systems require you to duplicate work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/job-search-rejections.html"&gt;what job search rejection looks like&lt;/a&gt;. In the end I got a job at FleetOps as 
Director of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through what I think an ideal candidate experience should be. Reality means that all of this isn't possible in all environments, but I strive
to ensure as much of this is in place in areas and companies I have a say in. A good candidate experience provides a good feeling about the company
and in any environment - candidate favoring or employer favoring - a happy candidate and new hire will be more effective joining a new company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="job-description"&gt;Job Description&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#job-description" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates are applying to a role at your company and should know what that role does. Regardless of whether the candidate is a referral from an 
executive or someone who is applying from a job board, the job description sets initial expectations for the role. Many engineers can smell 
marketing hype in a job description. Things like "ninja coder", very vague descriptions or numerous requirements. These are all negatives. A job 
description should be tailored to the role. It can also be reflective of the company's culture without being off putting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job descriptions should include salary ranges. In my experience, the listings with ranges get more applicants. Additionally, it's becoming a legal
requirement in many localities, especially in the United States. This should be a legitimate range. If the range is a hundred thousand dollar spread 
or higher, the believability is pretty low. It signals that the company either doesn't know what they want for this role, that they vastly under pay 
some of their team, vastly over pay some of their team or a combination of all of these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the job description should spell out the application process and expected and realistic timelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="application"&gt;Application&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step describes a software engineering hiring process. It requires up front work on the part of the company to ensure it goes smoothly. 
The application should be relatively simple. I'm a fan of not weeding out candidates at this stage and immediately sending them to a technical scenario. 
This only works if the process can be automated because a job can get hundreds or thousands of applicants. This should be made clear in the application
and process description that the next step is a technical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="technical-assessment"&gt;Technical Assessment&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#technical-assessment" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technical assessment should be real work. Do not do leetcode or code quizzes. If you use either of these, expect them to be easily answered by 
utilizing &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. Build a rubric so that every person being evaluated is judged the same way. You should be able to automate some of this
to build in responses that can easily weed out the candidates that are completely inexperienced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenarios should reflect the type of work they will perform on the job. Build the prompt to fit around a recent problem your team solved. Create a 
problem that is unique to your industry. Utilize the experiences of your existing team to create these scenarios. When building the rubric, do not 
build it so that the only possible solution is the one that your team came up with. There are many possible solutions to a problem. Ensure you get those
to truly see the experiences and expertise your candidates have to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build scenarios that have experience levels built in. A junior engineer is going to think about a problem in a different way than a staff engineer. 
The rubric should be reflective of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical assessment should be short and timed. At Woven, I told the companies I worked with the entire assessment (usually 2-4 scenarios) should not
last longer than two hours. Candidates are unwilling to take assessments that long. Additionally, untimed scenarios favor candidates that do not have 
other commitments - perhaps another job, family, or hobbies to name a few. Keep candidates on a level field as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="honorium"&gt;Honorium&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#honorium" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I've looked for specialized skillsets or executive roles, I've extended the time frame of scenarios and attached an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorarium"&gt;honorarium&lt;/a&gt;. This will
compensate the candidate for the longer time taken on the application. Unfortunately, free labor is common in the technology industry interview process.
This is to show the company isn't seeking free labor on a problem. It may need to be explained to candidates due to the experiences they have had with
other interview processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="remote-work"&gt;Remote work&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#remote-work" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/remote-work-thoughts-about-offices.html"&gt;I am a huge fan of remote work.&lt;/a&gt; With the proper company structure, I can hire from a global candidate pool. It's important that the team is 
able to support their new coworkers regardless of their location in the world. I've seen teams and companies expand their developer ranks by slowly 
expanding the timezones they hire from instead of immediately jumping to global. The trade off here is that you are missing candidates that would be 
good for you team immediately and in turn you are slowly training your team to operate on a broader set of timezones and be more asyncronous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the team expands requires careful consideration of team dynamics and executive support. It should also be a discussion the hiring manager is 
prepared to have with candidates. "Remote" does not always mean someone sitting a handful of timezones away. For some it may mean that they like to 
travel and could be in the same timezone as you this month and over the winter they are half a world away. How will you, as a team and as a manager,
respond to this type of situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onboarding"&gt;Onboarding&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#onboarding" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've made a decision to hire someone, the hiring manager should remain in contact with the candidate. Don't just hand things over to Human 
Resources and assume everything is perfect. Changing jobs and starting a new job is a big deal. Talk with the candidate on next steps. Ensure they are
getting the right equipment to perform their job. Start setting up the first tasks they will be doing when they join the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day one is going to consist of HR work. There is paperwork to fill out, there are things to sign, there are policies to go over, and insurance to sign 
up for (in the US at least). Everyone with a job has done this stuff. Build this time into their first days on the job. Day one also consists of getting
the new employee access to systems and introductions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work with the employee and provide a checklist of things they should be doing and who they should be working with to complete these first items. They 
don't know who in HR to work with because they are new. They don't know their team lead because they are new. The hiring manager should make these 
introductions easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up expectations for the first week or two, the first month and first three months. They will need to learn the environment, get access to the 
ticketing system and code repositories, and start making their first commits to the code base. But, that's not a day one thing. They will need to 
learn how system A talks to system B. Again, this is not a day one thing. A new user is going to get a firehose of information. Make it somewhat easier
for them by not expecting them to be an expert by the end of week two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intangables"&gt;Intangables&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#intangables" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hiring process has a lot of intangables that can make your candidates feel better or worse about your company. A few examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many interviews does the candidate have to go through? To many quickly burns out a candidate and makes the entire process feel like a waste of time. To few, or only technical interviews, doesn't give the candidate a sense of the company and the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the interviewers answer a candidate's questions? Candidates are interviewing you too. Does your interview team have the ability to answer a candidate's questions about the company, role expectations, day to day work, job perks, and more? Is the interview committee excited about a new teammate or are they stressed out/uninterested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the candidate receive updates on their application through out the process? Feedback is important and ghosting a candidate will quickly turn an excited candidate to one that doesn't want to join the team. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication with rejected candidates is important too. Coming back to ghosting a candidate and applicant tracking systems, these can be set up to send candidates emails based on what's happening with their application. If they are rejected, have the system send them a message. Please, PLEASE, don't use a default template for this though. There is a person receiving this email. They deserve more than "we're not moving forward at this time." If the hiring manager has talked to a candidate then this email should be more than the basic template sent to candidates rejected earlier in the process. A rejected candidate may reapply to a future role. How you inform them that you aren't hiring them right now determines if that candidate considers reapplying in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the company perceived to the outside world? A candidate wants to join your team, which means their name will be linked with your company for friends and family at least. Future jobs will associate your company with their name. The candidate may ask about this perception - recent news articles, CEO announcements, blog posts - and the interview team should be able to answer these types of questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing is different at each company, but candidates don't know what the process looks like at each until they are into the process. The earlier
this process is communicated to them, the smoother the candidate's experience will be. This requires that the company and hiring manager have spent time
building the job description, technical assessments, and interview cycles ahead of time. Organization is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is more important. The candidate is applying to join your team. How you communicate with them is their first indication on how they will
be communicated with as an employee. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job"/><category term="meta"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - Now AI is bad?

A recent blog post by Stack Exchange shows they don't trust GenAI either so why are they pushing it so hard?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous posts about the ongoing &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;moderator and curator strike on the Stack Exchange network&lt;/a&gt; can be found linked at the bottom
of this post, or by visiting the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/category/stack-exchange-strike.html"&gt;Stack Exchange Strike&lt;/a&gt; category on this site. I'd post a summary about what's happened in the last 
ten days, but there is nothing to report. There are discussions, but no agreements. The appointed Stack Exchange employee empowered to 
talk with moderators stepped back and is not participating any longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow marks the one month point. We are hours away from 10,000 pending moderator flags on Stack Overflow. This is up from 78 (yes, 
two digits, in mid-May). The way this has gone down, the lack of progress, and the continued mischaracterization of moderators to the press
hasn't motivated me to spend my free time to volunteer in the last long though. I still have this feeling that Stack Exchange is looking 
at the reddit protests recently with their demand that moderators return to the community and wondering if they can replicate that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-confusion"&gt;New confusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#new-confusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 3, 2023 &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230703161433/https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/03/do-large-language-models-know-what-they-are-talking-about/"&gt;Stack Overflow published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; entitled: "Do large language models know what they are talking about?". Spoiler:
the conclusion of the article is "Nope."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the interesting thing. The interesting thing is how this answer is presented. The very last paragraph of the post cuts to
the heart of the matter that &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;moderators on Stack Overflow raised in December when we banned ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating AI-generated information as purely actionable might be the biggest danger of LLMs, especially as more and more web content gets generated by GPT and others: weâll be awash in information that no one understands. The original knowledge will have been vacuumed up by deep learning models, processed into vectors, and spat out as statistically accurate answers.  Weâre already in a golden age of misinformation as anyone can use their sites to publish anything that they please, true or otherwise, and none of it gets vetted. Imagine when the material doesnât even have to pass through a human editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw this in action with ChatGPT. We still see it in action with ChatGPT and it's still a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/425409/189134"&gt;problem users are becoming more aware of&lt;/a&gt; as the 
strike continues. We saw it when Stack Exchange tried their &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-does-stackexchange-care.html"&gt;formatting assistant&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow. What I see here is Stack Overflow
admitting that the moderators are correct, in public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing about that paragraph is that it links to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/26/23773914/ai-large-language-models-data-scraping-generation-remaking-web"&gt;article from The Verge&lt;/a&gt; that quotes the Stack Overflow moderators
and the decision to ban AI. It also has this dig at Stack Exchange executives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mods say AI output canât be trusted, but execs say itâs worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their own post is explaining why it's not worth the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-this-mean"&gt;What's this mean?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-this-mean" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this as more communication failure on Stack Exchange's part. In an &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-week-one.html"&gt;update I posted weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, I linked to internal emails that
where leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are we messaging this? Who is allowed to post and respond to questions and comments on Meta, chat, social media, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Community Leadership Team ([redacted]) are working together in close coordination with Marketing ([redacted]) on comms. They will post and respond to questions on-site. Unless you are specifically tapped to respond to something please do not engage. It is best to avoid commenting on anything related to this action on site, even if you think you have something helpful to add. Please get review and approval from Philippe prior to posting on site, or from [redacted] if you are approached off-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone, somewhere, didn't realize what this blog post was about or what it linked to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, nothing changes with this. The company has dug in so hard on forcing GenAI to be on the sites and is marching toward an announcement
of somekind in late July 2023 about AI. In the meantime, I can only see blog posts like this one as an indication that Stack Exchange
doesn't know what they are attempting to build toward and at the same time have come to the conclusion (or at least a team within Stack 
Exchange has) that GenAI isn't to be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the community said back in December and continues to say now. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - How does the company regain my trust?</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-regaining-trust.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-06-23T23:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-23T23:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-06-23:/stackexchange-moderator-strike-regaining-trust.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking.

&lt;p&gt;My previous posts about the ongoing &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;moderator and curator strike on the Stack Exchange network&lt;/a&gt; can be found linked at the bottom
of this post, or by visiting the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/category/stack-exchange-strike.html"&gt;Stack Exchange Strike&lt;/a&gt; category on this site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390626/186281"&gt;originally posted on Meta Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the network wide "Meta" for the Stack Exchange network. This meta site and the 
"child meta" sites mentioned in the post are utilized by community members to discuss the network itself. This is where questions about 
how the individual site or the network as a whole are posted, where policies are determined, where questions about questions are discussed. 
This is the location that the community has to make their voice heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is my answer to the question "What is needed for users to trust the Stack Exchange company?" It's been edited slightly to fit
the format of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-will-my-trust-be-regained"&gt;How will my trust be regained?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-my-trust-be-regained" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="short-version"&gt;Short version&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#short-version" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I'm not sure and that's a bad thing for me and for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I'm not going to segment the company into various groups. I've gotten the impression from moderator representatives that this is a bad thing and they are offended by this segmentation. I have no desire to further that, so "Stack Exchange" in this case refers to both the company as a whole and all employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author note&lt;/em&gt;: This complaint was relayed by the moderator representatives from Stack Exchange during discussions. It seems that using phrases 
like "management" and "leadership" is being interpreted as "good staff" vs "bad staff" at Stack Exchange. While I disagree with this, to me it's 
not worth the argument thus it's just "Stack Exchange" for me from now on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="who-am-i"&gt;Who am I?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#who-am-i" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, I've been on the network for nearly 14 years. I'm a moderator on Stack Overflow, Hardware Recommendations and Community Building. I have built automated tooling to flag comments (at one point accounting for 15% of the comment flags raised on Stack Overflow in a year), and I am an admin on the community led Smoke Detector (spam detection) project. In short, I know this network, the tooling it does and does not have, and various communities across the network. My time here is voluntary. Time that I, until recently, was happy to provide without much of a thought. I've had very interesting discussions with fellow moderators and Stack Exchange employees throughout my time here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-dont-i-trust-stack-exchange"&gt;Why don't I trust Stack Exchange?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-dont-i-trust-stack-exchange" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is needed for users to trust the Stack Exchange company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange has gone through this cycle before. I've written about it in those past cycles for anyone who wishes to go through my profile and fine previous thoughts. Each time, less of my energy comes back as we - community and company - reconcile and bury the problem in the sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last major cycle ended with a lot of lawyer language, including the new &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/legal/moderator-agreement"&gt;moderator agreement&lt;/a&gt; that every mod had to accept to retain their diamond. This cycle started with a violation of one of the provisions of that agreement by Stack Exchange. It received a, in my opinion, flippant "Oops, that was my fault" by the Vice President of Community at Stack Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells me that the legal agreement is completely one sided and Stack Exchange feels comfortable violating it without repercussion. If I, on the other hand, had violated a term in the agreement I'd be forced to hand in my diamond. This has eroded a ton of trust I have with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the announcement regarding how Generative AI can and should be moderated and in statements to the press, there has been disparagement against the moderators of the network. To me, the subtext of all of that reads as "we don't trust you to moderate correctly". If the company does not trust us to perform activities we've either been elected or appointed to do for our community, why are we still here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining this with the incredible way this cycle all started and the fact that none of this mistrust was known by the moderation team, my trust of the company took a hit. This policy was announced at the end of May. Data was shared several weeks ago. In all of that, there are allusions to improper moderator activity and hints that moderators are banning so many people that engagement across the platform is down. It wasn't until yesterday (nearly a month) that moderators saw any discussion of these "improper bans". It was just...silent. This big, massive problem that could have been talked about back in February or March was just tossed into the public eye with the implication that moderators are doing the wrong thing. Then it took nearly a month for a conversation to begin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stack Exchange network has lost &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; four months of time where this "moderation problem" could have been discussed, policies adjusted, and moderators who deal with generative AI on their sites on the daily basis educating the company on how it's actually being detected. Instead, an easily disproved lie about using ChatGPT detectors has been blamed and shared repeatedly with the press for the reason for their sudden policy change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My trust level of the company takes several hits here too. I dislike being lied to and I really dislike being lied about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the method of communication through out the last month. The company has a team dedicated to managing the community. There have been many questions on this site and on child metas during the moderator strike. I have seen very little coming from the community management team to answer these questions. The community has questions and the company is not providing answers to them. Instead, we see announcements on topics that the community is &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; being announced. Long discussions, in public, are not occurring though. Which erodes my trust even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whats-this-all-mean"&gt;What's this all mean?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-this-all-mean" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where am I today then? How does the company rebuild my trust in them? My answer to that is that I don't know. This past month has eroded so much of my faith in the company to be the trusted repository of knowledge that it was in the past. It's also removed much faith that the company actually cares about the community. Much like the previous cycle we've seen details come out that reflect poorly on the company and employees attempt to respond to that only for &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; details to come out that make the response look like lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 years is a lot of time to spend some place and not have strong feelings about. It makes simply accepting negative changes impossible and it makes walking away difficult. That's part of why I'm still here. The other part is the communities I mentioned in my introduction. I have built friends and acquaintances across the network and the sense of community that used to exist is a strong desire to remain. But, this isn't something that will hold the community as a whole together. I am an outlier in terms of a user on the network. Honestly, everyone reading this on Meta is an outlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's goal is engagement and traffic. I guarantee the moderation team has not banned enough users to bring down the traffic the network has seen since December. But, we are the scapegoat at least right now. We're nearing a month and there are users with access to site analytics. The number of bans has been close to 0. Theoretically, traffic should be recovering if we were the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - Personal Frustrations</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-personal-frustrations.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-06-21T11:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-21T11:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-06-21:/stackexchange-moderator-strike-personal-frustrations.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking.

&lt;h2 id="recap"&gt;Recap&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#recap" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html"&gt;The Moderation and curator strike started on June 5.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange has downplayed the effect of this to the press, while at the same time straight lied to the press about &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;causes of the strike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-week-one.html"&gt;removed access to the data dump back&lt;/a&gt; in March but never told anyone until they were called out on it in early June.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-update.html"&gt;moderation team has elected three representatives&lt;/a&gt; to engage with Stack Exchange to solve these problems and end the strike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange launches the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-does-stackexchange-care.html"&gt;GenAI powered formatting assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The community quickly shows that it's very bad at it's job and it is shut down temporarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-new"&gt;What's new?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-new" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Stack Exchange announced the upcoming launch of a new &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/390463/186281"&gt;Prompt Design site&lt;/a&gt;. To say the community disliked the idea
would be an understatement. The community has pointed out that this will be incredibly niche, with very short term answers because
models update constantly. There are also concerns that this will essentially become a "write my prompt" (instead of "write my code")
site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all of those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also hidden in this announcement is another announcement. Stack Exchange is changing their method of launching new sites. This is
something that should have it's own announcement. This is a big deal and the community has been asking for improvements to the 
Area 51 incubator site for a decade. Unfortunately, the new method is to completely do away with all of the work that Area 51
does - building a community, setting intitial questions, helping to set scope, ensuring there is an audience for the topic - and
instead launching with a "Community Stakeholders" group that will do the work in either a private Stack Overflow for Teams instance
or a read only chatroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those options entirely exclude people that may want to participate but don't have access. It adds barriers that don't exist 
on Area 51. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-thoughts"&gt;My thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement sets a launch date of July 26 for this new site. This is the day before the CEO talks at 
WeAreDevelopers World Congress. A venure where the company has been promising a major AI announcement for months. This new site,
combined with the formatting assistant failure from last week, is starting to show clearly what the company wants to do here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-does-stackexchange-care.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; that I was becoming more pesimistic that this strike doesn't end with resignations.
That continues to hold true. I also mentioned that Stack Exchanges seems to be keeping an eye on the Reddit strike - 
first with the blackouts, then with the John Oliver protests and currently with the NSFW toggles to prevent ads. Last night, 
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767848/reddit-blackout-api-protest-moderators-suspended-nsfw"&gt;Reddit started removing moderators&lt;/a&gt; as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the lack of updates and communication from Stack Exchange to the moderators and curators in the last week, I can't help but 
think that something similar is being discussed at Stack Exchange. Time will tell, but my feeling is that Stack Exchange is going
to plow ahead with GenAI content on their platform. They are going to burn 15 years of trust and quality content and they are going
to do with regardless of what the community wants. If they community protests, they will be shown the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I'm still pretty pesimistic about all of this. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - Does Stack Exchange Care?</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-does-stackexchange-care.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-06-19T14:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-19T14:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-06-19:/stackexchange-moderator-strike-does-stackexchange-care.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking.

&lt;h2 id="recap"&gt;Recap&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#recap" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html"&gt;The Moderation and curator strike started on June 5.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange has downplayed the effect of this to the press, while at the same time straight lied to the press about &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;causes of the strike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-week-one.html"&gt;removed access to the data dump back&lt;/a&gt; in March but never told anyone until they were called out on it in early June.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-update.html"&gt;moderation team has elected three representatives&lt;/a&gt; to engage with Stack Exchange to solve these problems and end the strike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-are-we-now"&gt;Where are we now?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-are-we-now" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I ended with a note that the data dumps should be restored by June 16. Good news. That has been completed and the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/389922/186281"&gt;dump was uploaded&lt;/a&gt; by June 16. It's 
progress, but after two weeks we have only accomplished one out of four tasks on the list of conditions to end the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retraction of the of the prohibition of moderating GPT content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private policy on GPT content that was issued to moderators must be revealed publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The data dumps must be re-enabled and SEDE and API access guarenteed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange, Inc. must communicate, gather feedback, and act on that feedback before making major policy or software changes to the public platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard rumors that the second bullet may occur, but nothing has been done publicly. Thus, nothing outside of feedback from representatives to go on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gpt-content"&gt;GPT Content&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gpt-content" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, June 15, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/425162/189134"&gt;Stack Exchange enabled their "formatting assistant".&lt;/a&gt; To say it went poorly, is an understatement. There are currently 52 answers to that
question showing how it doesn't work. It's a thin wrapper around a version of ChatGPT or GPT4. It's also very, very bad at being a "formatting assistant". Instead,
it's &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/425176/189134"&gt;rewriting content&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/425165/189134"&gt;butchering code being asked about&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/425169/189134"&gt;making stuff up&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/425190/189134"&gt;answering questions&lt;/a&gt; and everything other than making formatting 
better. One user, Mithical, found the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/425208/189134"&gt;prompt the formatting assistant&lt;/a&gt; is using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one small postive that came out of this is that Stack Exchange did &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/425081/189134"&gt;communicate with the community&lt;/a&gt; a few days before this was released. This isn't enough 
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="communication"&gt;Communication&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why isn't one post enough? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes it's become clearer to me that several staff members of Stack Exchange don't wish to engage with the community. I briefly touched on one of these
people in my [last update][strikeweek1update]. The public press has been out of the loop sounding, the internal reactions on moderation channels has been 
complaints that moderators are to negative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course moderators are negative right now. &lt;em&gt;There is a strike going on because they are unhappy&lt;/em&gt;. The feedback from representatives continues to be filled with
road blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-do-i-sit-today"&gt;Where do I sit today?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-do-i-sit-today" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's becoming more clear that Stack Exchange is not interested in removing GenerativeAI content from it's site. It's actively building and promoting a tool
that utilizes ChatGPT under the hood. I am very surprised that they pulled the plug on the formatting assistant after two days. Previous negative feedback has been 
ignored and I fully expected this one to be as well. The problem with pulling the plug on this, is that CEO has committed to exciting announcements about AI this 
summer. If the community just showed that one of those AI projects was a flop, they are going to go even harder at getting the next one to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this drags on into it's third week, I've become more pesimistic that this strike doesn't end with resignations. Reddit had a two day strike during this 
time period, and they are already threatening to replace community moderators. The Stack Exchange CEO has expressed their fondness for Reddit on occassion,
so I suspect that the action being taken over there is being considered here. Of course, the difference here is that Stack Exchange wasn't effectively shut down
by the strike like Reddit was. Sites didn't go dark. Instead, curators and moderators stopped curating and moderating. Everything is still available,
the sites are still working, it's just less tidy than usual. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike Update 2</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-update.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-06-13T23:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-13T23:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-06-13:/stackexchange-moderator-strike-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking.

&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's update summarized the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-week-one.html"&gt;first week of the Stack Exchange Moderator strike&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html"&gt;strike began last Monday&lt;/a&gt;
with an &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;open letter to Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend the moderators, and community curators elected three representatives to talk with Stack Exchange. Those talks started this week.
They went into these discussions to reiterate the four conditions to end the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retraction of the of the prohibition of moderating GPT content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private policy on GPT content that was issued to moderators must be revealed publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data dumps must be re-enabled and SEDE and API access guarenteed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange, Inc. must communicate, gather feedback, and act on that feedback before making major policy or software changes to the public platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where are we now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-update"&gt;The update&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-update" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="representatives"&gt;Representatives&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#representatives" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions with Stack Exchange started off less than stellar, in my opinion. Quoting from the Vice President of Community at Stack Exchange, as 
relayed to those of us not in the discussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So in summary:  Cesar is my delegate for issues here, while I reserve final decision making to myself I"ve vested him with broad discretionary authority and we're meeting on a frequent (daily or multiple times daily) basis to clear any differences between us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My take away here is that the Vice President of Community - a person who's job should involve &lt;em&gt;dealing with the community&lt;/em&gt; doesn't think this is 
important enough to attend. While I've worked with Cesar in my role as a moderator, this is just making Cesar the car salesman that has to 
"talk with the manager about your offer". It's a way for the company to drag this out and a way to make a the real decisions without moderation
input. I fully expect to hear from the community representatives that Cesar liked a proposal but the VP did not but that the VP wasn't around to 
discuss why not. I'd love to be proven wrong on that though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="data-dumps"&gt;Data Dumps&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#data-dumps" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data dumps are the third bullet on our list of things that must be restored. Good news! Stack Exchange will have those restored by June 16, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390200/186281"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390202/186281"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;) by the VP of Community - the one not attending the talks above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]
Our intention was never to stop posting the data dump, only to begin to collect more information on how it was being used and by whom - especially in light of the rise of LLMs and questions around how genAI models are handling attribution. However, itâs clear that many individual users (academics, researchers, etc) have an immediate need to access updated versions of the dumps. So we are re-enabling the automatic data dumps (and uploading the one thatâs about a week overdue). We believe that this can happen by end of the day Friday. We will continue to work toward the creation of certain guardrails (for large AI/LLM companies) for both the dumps and the API, but again - we have no intention of restricting/charging community members or other responsible users of the dumps or the API from accessing them.
[...]
In the meantime, the data dumps will be re-enabled by end of day Friday. We will communicate here when that has been completed or if there are any delays. We will also post here prior to making any future changes to the dumps or distribution of the dumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose now we wait to see if there are any "delays" before Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message was confirmed by one of the Co-Founders that has since left Stack Exchange and 
&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/04/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/"&gt;originally committed to these data dumps back in June 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have confirmation via email from Prashanth that this is, indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the new official policy&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm glad to see it. Creative Commons is part of our contract with the community, and it should never be broken -- however, CC does need to address the AI issue in an updated license, in my personal opinion. [...] - &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/390201/what-is-the-current-june-2023-status-of-the-data-dumps-and-the-company-s-commi?noredirect=1&amp;amp;lq=1#comment1302765_390202"&gt;Jeff Atwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy with this concession and confirmation of the concession from our representatives, Stack Exchange and a Co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's telling that once again it's Philippe making statements that are lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's done it with posts to the press that I mentioned yesterday (moderators are depending on GPT detectors!). He's done it with the internal 
emails to his own coworkers. He's doing it again here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intention was never to stop posting the data dump...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390040/186281"&gt;directly contridicts that statement provided by the Stack Exchange Chief Technology Officer&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow senior leadership is working on a strategy to protect Stack Overflow data from being misused by companies building LLMs. While working on this strategy, we decided to stop the dump until we could put guardrails in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For being a VP of Community, the ability to communicate with the community is greatly lacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ai-policy"&gt;AI Policy&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ai-policy" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much more progress has been provided by the community representatives. From what I have seen, Stack Exchange is pushing to call an end of this
with the promise of a new policy. But it's not done yet. They'll work on it with the moderators and once that's done, that will replace the current 
policy that started the strike. The representative mentioned they were pushing for a deadline on how quickly moderators would be able to commit to this 
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is a way to end the community's moderation strike and agree to essentially nothing. It's another promise that something will happen. 
It gets the community back to moderation (which Stack Exchange employees have been doing for the week), and if they break that promise the effort to 
re-organize action has to start all over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm not agreeing to go back to utilizing my free time to perform moderation duties without knowing what the new policy is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-do-i-sit"&gt;Where do I sit?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-do-i-sit" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like yesterday, I continue to re-evaluate my relationship with Stack Exchange. I'm really happy that the data dump has been restored. The messaging
around it though continues to erode my trust in the company's actions. This was also one of the easier items for Stack Exchange to agree to, even 
though it looks like a co-founder may have had a hand in resolving this as well. I don't know if that's true and I appreciate the work the 
representatives have done to resolve our first point of contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also very telling that the messaging doesn't mention the restoration in the context of the strike at all. If the company was attempting to 
build goodwill in this environment, I'd think they would point to the conditions in the open letter and tie the enablement of the data dumps directly
to that. Instead, we got a statement that says they didn't intend to stop posting the data dump, directly contridicting a previous statement saying
senior leadership decided to stop the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Exchange Strike - Week One</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike-week-one.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-06-12T09:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-06-12:/stackexchange-moderator-strike-week-one.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking. This is my my summary of the first week.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week ago, many &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html"&gt;Stack Exchange diamond moderators began a moderation strike&lt;/a&gt;. They have been joined by 
power users and curators. At the time of this post, there are over 1200 users that have signed the &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;open letter to Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strike has been covered in a few news articles, but I suspect this week's actions against Reddit and their new API pricing
changes will overshadow Stack Overflow for a little while. That's fine with me. Perhaps cooler heads will prevail when there is 
less public focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stack Exchange strike has been covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-stack-overflow-content-moderation-chat-gpt-1850505609"&gt;On Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a33dj/stack-overflow-moderators-are-striking-to-stop-garbage-ai-content-from-flooding-the-site"&gt;On Vice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://devclass.com/2023/06/05/stack-overflow-volunteer-moderators-down-tools-over-secret-new-policy-that-obstructs-removal-of-ai-generated-content/"&gt;On DevClass&lt;/a&gt; (with an inverview from a fellow Charcoal power user and Stack Overflow moderator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing in this set of articles is the public statement that was released by Philippe Beaudette, Vice President of Community (taken from the Vice article above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small number of moderators (11%) across the Stack Overflow network have stopped engaging in several activities, including moderating content. The primary reason for this action is dissatisfaction with our position on detection tools regarding AI-generated content. Stack Overflow ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools that moderators were previously using have an alarmingly high rate of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand by our decision to require that moderators stop using the tools previously used. We are confident that we will find a path forward. We regret that actions have progressed to this point, and the Community Management team is evaluating the current situation as we work hard to stabilize things in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They doubled down on this explaination in two meta posts. The &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/389834/186281"&gt;initial statement&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/389928/186281"&gt;post with "data"&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage readers 
to spend a while reading through that second link and the answers. The community is skeptical of the conclusions drawn and 
have counter arguments and data scattered in the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, during the week it was discovered that Stack Exchange stopped their quarterly data dump of all content. This was 
&lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390040/186281"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; after a former employee stated that the data dumps were turned off in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow senior leadership is working on a strategy to protect Stack Overflow data from being misused by companies building LLMs. While working on this strategy, we decided to stop the dump until we could put guardrails in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on setting up the infrastructure to do this correctly in the age of LLMs --- where we continue to be open and share the data with our developer community but work to set up a formal framework for large AI companies that want to leverage the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for ways to gate access to the Dump, APIs, and SEDE, that will allow individuals access to the data while preventing misuse by organizations looking to profit from the work of our community. We are working to design and implement appropriate safeguards and still sorting out the details and timelines. We will provide regular updates on our progress to this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-are-we-now"&gt;Where are we now?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-are-we-now" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the summary out of the way, where do we sit now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of midnight today, the users that have stopped moderation activities have &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/390106/186281"&gt;selected three representatives&lt;/a&gt; to be our voice
in conversations with Stack Exchange and listed the conditions for ending the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retraction of the of the prohibition of moderating GPT content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private policy on GPT content that was issued to moderators must be revealed publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data dumps must be re-enabled and SEDE and API access guarenteed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange, Inc. must communicate, gather feedback, and act on that feedback before making major policy or software changes to the public platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point out that there is nothing here about GPT detection tools. That's because this isn't the reasong for the strike. 
Despite what Stack Exchange has said in their messages to the press, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/389856/186281"&gt;this isn't about detection tools&lt;/a&gt;. (I also have 
&lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/389825/186281"&gt;an answer&lt;/a&gt; on that question about the policy's origination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery that the data dumps were turned off has angered many people - those both already involved and others that learned of 
it this week. The fact that these were turned off over two months ago and nothing was said to the community has made the situation
even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-stack-saying"&gt;What's Stack Saying?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-stack-saying" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section was added after original publication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after publishing my thoughts with this article, internal Stack Exchange emails were published. These show how 
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230612155947/https://jlericson.com/2023/06/12/internal_messages.html"&gt;Stack Exchange is communicating this with their employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage everyone to read &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; too. There is a lot of reading scattered around to get the full scope
of how unhappy the users of Stack Exchange are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's telling that the company managed to copy and paste from the &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;strike letter&lt;/a&gt;, but at the same time managed 
to completely ignore that this isn't about GPT detectors. Even worse, the company is spreading that falsehood to it's employees,
and the press. On top of that, has two teams - Community Leadership and Marketing - working on communications, yet no progress
has been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-do-i-sit"&gt;Where do I sit?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-do-i-sit" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that I've been here for over 13 years. I've applied and interviewed at the company. I've 
made friends with the employees and gotten recommendations during those interviews. I've built tooling to help &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;moderate comments&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;eliminate spam&lt;/a&gt; on the network. I've been here a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I reevaluated my role on the network during Stack Exchange's last screw up. In that one, they managed to libel a moderator,
by name, to the press. This event still reverberates through the network today and serves as a brick that this current situation is
built with. Stack Exchange destroyed 10 years worth of trust and community relationships in that event. They've tried to rebuild it
over these last three years and have been marginally successful. That's gone again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm reevaluating how I utilize my free time again. It's not constructive to say I'll hand in my diamonds and walk away if the
conditions above aren't hit. But, it's worth noting that I agree with all four of those conditions. This is my free time I'm donating
and if the organization I'm donating that time to has changed their philosphy, I will take that into consideration as I reevaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we are long past the point of "how it used to be" at Stack Exchange. The question I am asking my self is whether or not I
agree with the new direction the platform is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated after the email publication, above&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the email and FAQ that Stack Exchange sent to their employees, I am struck by how out of touch members of the company are.
Not the people that don't interact with the community. The people that should know the pulse of the moderation teams, the 
community opinions, and users in general - like the Vice President of Community. While I'm not surprised that they are 
down playing the strike, I am surprised that they are flat out lying to their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange should be called out on that and their employees should know that it's happening. Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Inc.,
is lying to their employees. The email presented was written after the strike started and contains information about all of the 
FAQ items mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Stack Exchange Strike"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Joining the Stack Exchange Moderator Strike</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-06-05T01:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-05T01:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-06-05:/stackexchange-moderator-strike.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange moderators are striking. This is my reasoning for why I'm joining.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm signing an open letter to Stack Exchange because those of us that volunteer our time and energy have 
been put in an impossible situation. On Stack Overflow we &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;banned ChatGPT created content&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately
after it was released. Theorectically, that is not longer in effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't due to a change in community perception. Instead, it's due to an &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/389583/186281"&gt;abrupt policy change&lt;/a&gt; on Stack
Exchange's part that was posted on May 30. It's important to note that this public policy does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; match
the guidance that was provided privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant portion of this public policy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help mitigate the issue, we've asked moderators to apply a very strict standard of evidence to determining whether a post is AI-authored when deciding to suspend a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private policy notes that "very strict" is essentially "don't moderate unless they explicitly say it was created by an AI".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stack Exchange CEO &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/05/31/ceo-update-paving-the-road-forward-with-ai-and-community-at-the-center/"&gt;posted a blog post&lt;/a&gt; at the end of May 2023. In this post, they stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10% of our company is working on features and applications leveraging GenAI that have the potential to increase engagement within our public community and add value to customers of our SaaS product, Stack Overflow for Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes against the community desire to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have GenAI content on the site. The CEO has not provided any feedback to the community,
other than a note that there is a big summer project with GenAI. The community reaction hasn't been positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining this announcement with the newly announced policy the previous day, and an astonishing inability to articulate more details or reasoning,
has producted a lot of unhappy moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I feel that the company has destroyed 3 years of rebuilding trust. Back in 2019, they destroyed this trust and nearly had a moderator
strike then too. That involved providing information to a journalist that had very limited context and due to that, presented a single moderator in 
unflattering light. The feelings from that have taken years to rebuild and even today that incident is cited as a low point, and users can point
out that singular incident when trust of the company plummetted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public announcement to not moderate GenAI content contained this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through no fault of moderators' own, we also suspect that there have been biases for or against residents of specific countries as a potential result of the heuristics being applied to these posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's just wrong. Absolutely wrong. It is 100% inaccurate and Stack Exchange has offered no data to back this up. User country of origin, region in the world, or any kind of physical location is not available to moderators. We are present a flag and given information to the content that has been flagged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-am-i-participating"&gt;Why am I participating?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-am-i-participating" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...my participation? Why am I joining in? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange, and Stack Overflow, thrive due to the human element. It's userbase has been around over a decade and answered millions of questions across over 180 sites. The week ChatGPT came out, the community saw the bad results it can provide. For the past 6 months, we've continued to see how bad that is. The moderation teams across the network to generate a policy and get it approved by the company. I've reproduced it in full below, but as of this post it is still on the site and contridicts the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to completely ignoring the community's input on how they do not want GenAI on the site, the company ignored their own &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/legal/moderator-agreement"&gt;moderator agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the assumption that the above will change at some point, the relevant section is pasted here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```
Stack Exchange, Inc. agrees that it will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. Respect your privacy per the terms of the Privacy Policy for the Public Network.
   ii.  Get your explicit written permission before commenting to any media (including media outlets controlled by Stack Exchange Inc.) or independent reporters about you or your moderator actions as per our Press Policy.
   iii.  Allow you to resign your position for any reason without penalty or repercussions. As a volunteer, Stack Exchange, Inc. respects your time and will release you from duty should you ask.
   iv. Operate âStack Gives Backâ, an annual program giving to selected charities in honor of our moderators.
   v. Post previews for review of all new official policies in the Moderators Teams instance with the policy tag, marked with links to their public version once published, and maintain a listing of all official network-wide policies with links to them in the Help Center.
   vi. Announce changes to the moderator agreement no less than sixty days before the deadline to accept the new agreement with a period of at least thirty days for discussion and review.
   vii. Provide support for your questions, requests and concerns on the Moderators Teams instance and/or the Teachersâ Lounge, direct email to CMs, and content on Meta escalated to staff by whatever formal documented process is in effect at the time.
   viii. Respect your right to speak openly to question and challenge policy without reprisal so long as such speech does not break the Code of Conduct.
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant section is &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;. There was no discussion period on this. No engagement with the moderators, or the community. Instead it was "effective
immediately." The best we've gotten so far is an "oops, sorry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not now something in a &lt;code&gt;/legal&lt;/code&gt; link should operate. If I can't trust  them to uphold an agreement they have in writing, why should I trust
them to uphold anything else? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-community-want-out-of-this"&gt;What does the community want out of this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-the-community-want-out-of-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the open letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Stack Overflow, Inc. retracts this policy change to a degree that addresses the concerns of the moderators, and allows moderators to effectively enforce established policies against AI-generated answers, we are calling for a general moderation strike, as a last-resort effort to protect the Stack Exchange platform and users from a total loss in value. We would also like to remind Stack Overflow, Inc. that a network that entirely relies on volunteers for its moderation model cannot then consistently ignore, mistreat, and malign those same volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-feelings-on-this"&gt;My feelings on this&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-feelings-on-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange for over 13 years. I've been a moderator on the network since 2014 and on Stack Overflow since 2017.
I've &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/tag/stack-exchange.html"&gt;written about Stack Overflow a bit over the years&lt;/a&gt;. I've participated in &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291301/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically"&gt;Charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, the spam fighting community since 2015ish. This project
has automatically flagged more than 86,000 posts across the network since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've applied to several jobs at Stack Exchange. I've interviewed for a couple positions. I have spent &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time with the network, the 
community, moderators, and employees making this a great place for internet users to find their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have helped to build the community/company trust that I mentioned above. I watched it crumble. I thought about leaving in 2019, but instead
spent the next three years working to rebuild that trust. I'm at the point again, where I see the company not understanding their community. At all.
It's sad that this cycle has repeated itself and it's worse that the company is, again, tossing their most engaged users under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strike serves two purposes in my mind - the first is the officially stated one. Do not all GenAI content on the network. It will erode the value of the network quickly. We've also demonstrated that ChatGPT and it's peers are not great at answering complex questions. But, second, and unofficially, 
this strike will represent a change for Stack Exchange to show whether or not they care about what the community has to say. This is, I believe, the last
opportunity for them to retract this policy and reflect on why they are over ruling so many communities that reject GenAI in their community. It's their
last opportunity to show they support their moderators and the human aspect of moderation. Failure to do either means that Stack Exchange has given up
on community building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a volunteer for this community. I would love to continue that role, but this is the best way for me to show that GenAI is not the right path for the company to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's Next&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 5, 2023 at midnight, moderator local time, the network will start to see moderation activities cease (or slow down). I will be part of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gpt-policy"&gt;GPT Policy&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gpt-policy" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy was crafted with the input of moderators and Stack Exchange. An important thing to notice is that the moderators are empowered to issue suspensions. This is something the new policy prevents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```
Why posting GPT and ChatGPT generated answers is not currently acceptable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Help Center article provides insight and rationale on our policy regarding the usage of GPT and ChatGPT on Stack Overflow. While this is the position of Stack Overflow staff, itâs meant to support the prior work done by moderators (namely, the temporary policy issued to ban contributions by ChatGPT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow is a community built upon trust. The community trusts that users are submitting answers that reflect what they actually know to be accurate and that they and their peers have the knowledge and skill set to verify and validate those answers. The system relies on users to verify and validate contributions by other users with the tools we offer, including responsible use of upvotes and downvotes. Currently, contributions generated by GPT most often do not meet these standards and therefore are not contributing to a trustworthy environment. This trust is broken when users copy and paste information into answers without validating that the answer provided by GPT is correct, ensuring that the sources used in the answer are properly cited (a service GPT does not provide), and verifying that the answer provided by GPT clearly and concisely answers the question asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective nature of the content on Stack Overflow means that if any part of an answer is wrong, then the answer is objectively wrong. In order for Stack Overflow to maintain a strong standard as a reliable source for correct and verified information, such answers must be edited or replaced. However, because GPT is good enough to convince users of the site that the answer holds merit, signals the community typically use to determine the legitimacy of their peersâ contributions frequently fail to detect severe issues with GPT-generated answers. As a result, information that is objectively wrong makes its way onto the site. In its current state, GPT risks breaking readersâ trust that our site provides answers written by subject-matter experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderators are empowered (at their discretion) to issue immediate suspensions of up to 30 days to users who are copying and pasting GPT content onto the site, with or without prior notice or warning.
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-letter"&gt;The letter&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-letter" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter below was originally posted as an &lt;a href="https://openletter.mousetail.nl/"&gt;open letter to Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. I've reposted it here 
for a record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```
June 5, 2023
Stack Overflow, Inc. has decreed a near-total prohibition on moderating AI-generated content in the wake of a flood of such content being posted to and subsequently removed from the Stack Exchange network, tacitly allowing the proliferation of incorrect information ("hallucinations") and unfettered plagiarism on the Stack Exchange network. This poses a major threat to the integrity and trustworthiness of the platform and its content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the undersigned, are volunteer moderators, contributors, and users of Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network. Effective immediately, we are enacting a general moderation strike on Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network, in protest of this and other recent and upcoming changes to policy and the platform that are being forced upon us by Stack Overflow, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our efforts to effect change through proper channels have been ignored, and our concerns disregarded at every turn. Now, as a last resort, we are striking out of dedication to the platform that we have put over a decade of care and volunteer effort into. We deeply believe in the core mission of the Stack Exchange network: to provide a repository of high-quality information in the form of questions and answers, and the recent actions taken by Stack Overflow, Inc. are directly harmful to that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, moderators are no longer allowed to remove AI-generated answers on the basis of being AI-generated, outside of exceedingly narrow circumstances. This results in effectively permitting nearly all AI-generated answers to be freely posted, regardless of established community consensus on such content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, this allows incorrect information (colloquially referred to as "hallucinations") and plagiarism to proliferate unchecked on the platform. This destroys trust in the platform, as Stack Overflow, Inc. has previously noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the details of the policies issued directly to moderators differ substantially from the guidelines outlined publicly, with moderators barred from publicly sharing the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies disregard the leeway historically granted to individual Stack Exchange communities to determine their policies, by making changes without the input of the community, overriding community consensus, and outright refusing to reconsider their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this matter is resolved satisfactorily, we will be pausing activities including, but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Raising&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Running&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;anti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;spam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Closing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;voting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Deleting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;voting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Reviewing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;various&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;queues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Running&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;various&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;designed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;moderation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;such&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;detecting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plagiarism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id="preface"&gt;Preface&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is a bit different than some of my others. It's a direct response to an article. Over the past 9 months, as the 
technology industry contracts, we've seen return to office orders from countless companies. Combined with the, roughly, 
&lt;a href="https://layoffs.fyi/"&gt;300k layoffs&lt;/a&gt; between August 1, 2022 and May 23, 2023 (&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/looking-for-new-role.html"&gt;I was laid off in that time frame too&lt;/a&gt;), we've seen &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of 
articles about how many companies are recalling people to the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is short sighted. Remote work, when done properly, is the way of the future and forcing everyone back into an 
office is not going to work as expected. One of the bright spots from the COVID-19 pandemic was that society learned many jobs
can be done from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-article"&gt;The article&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-article" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article I'm responding to is &lt;a href="https://flocrivello.com/changing-my-mind-on-remote-about-being-in-san-francisco/"&gt;Changing my mind on remote, moving the team back to San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; by Flo Crivello. This
isn't designed to pick on this author specifically, it's just the latest in a long line of these types of posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage readers to take a look at the article. It is well written. I, however, disagree with almost all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get started, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="counter-point"&gt;Counter point&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#counter-point" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of problems with this article. The short version is that it sounds like this company implemented remote work poorly, 
possibly during covid (I'm not sure how long they've been around). I think remote work is the best, especially for companies 
that does not need a local presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article raises four coordination cost bullet points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Itâs harder to get a hold of each other, as weâre not online at the same time. âIâll talk about it when I see him tomorrowâ â these delays compound in a huge way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So most interactions are async, leading to lower bandwidth, more context switching, and more things falling through the cracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even sync chats arenât as good. People canât interrupt each other or have sidebars, and there are bugs with video, audio, screenshare, etcâ¦ These frictions compound too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This causes us to be less aligned. Weâre only a few engineers right now, and yet people feel out of the loop on whoâs building what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three of these are the result of poor company policy and team expectations for how remote work will function. Remote 
work is still "work". It isn't "spend time by the pool with a laptop". It isn't "pick up groceries, mow the lawn, volunteer at the 
classroom parent, and maybe hop on a phone call". It is work. The team and company need to set that expectation. However, remote 
does offer the flexibility to do different things during the day. The company needs to be accepting of time zones, and time shifts.
Embrace the employees that are productive outside of a 9-5 working day, especially if your workforce is scattered across time zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company is fully remote, they should build in the async communication as part of their communication plan. &lt;a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/power-of-repetition-successful-leaders/"&gt;Good communication requires repetition&lt;/a&gt;. Asynchronous communication leads to that perfectly. Send a message in slack, send an email, mention it in Slack in another context, bring it up on an all hands call. Versus, only mentioning it once in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items falling through the cracks isn't a remote or async communication problem. It's a team problem. It's a leadership problem. 
It's a training problem. Don't blame remote work for this failure. Empower your team to make decisions that don't require 
constant input from others. This is one of the core points that &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/"&gt;GitLab's TeamOps&lt;/a&gt; has. &lt;a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/teamops/everyone-contributes/#give-agency"&gt;Give your teams agency&lt;/a&gt;
to make decisions without permission, review or approval. Do this, and those cracks get a lot smaller - regardless of 
where the employees work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synchronous chats having communication problems aren't great, but the reasons for failure that are listed by the author don't 
sound like a sync chat problem. "Interrupting", "having sidebars" - There are other avenues to communicate - zoom chat and 
slack are two examples. The bigger problem, in my opinion, is the requirement to always have video communication on in a company. 
This leads to fatigue due to communication patterns that don't exist in face to face communication (close eye contact, seeing 
your self, reduced mobility, and higher cognitive load). I argue that a well structured async communication plan and team 
will do better without constant sync communication. Sure, seeing people in person is helpful sometimes, but it's not required for 
all interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment problem is a leadership failure. I've worked remotely for the better part of a decade. I worked in an office for 
over a decade. Teams don't get misaligned because of remote work. They get misaligned because of leadership failures. Failure 
to communicate at all, or only slivers of data, will misalign a team faster than a network outage or Zoom failure will. Way 
faster. A poor company culture will ruin alignment in a way that a "My web cam isn't working today" could only dream of accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colocation is more fun too. You get to have lunch with your team, grab beers on Friday nights, play video games at the end of the day in the office, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This author does not care about a work life balance either for themselves or their employees. There are employees that absolutely 
love doing these things, building those relationships, and that's great. There are others that want to get home and spend time 
unwinding, being with family, hanging out with friends and none of that can be done if the boss is expecting you to go to the bar 
with them on a Friday night or stay at the office to play video games. Team building is important, but the way it's described here is 
not the way to build a team long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters not only because fun is fun, and building community is super important, but also because it helps build trust, which improves our work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal bias is going to show here, but my trust in team mates grows more through professional pursuits. How a team 
accomplishes a task or how a team responds to failure ( &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; how they respond to failure) is going to build that trust 
a lot more than going to a bar on a Friday. Going to a bar will build a personal friendship, but that is different than a 
professional level of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A]sk yourself which of the following competitors youâd be most afraid of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bunch of hackers coding on a couch in an apartment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team thatâs fully colocated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team thatâs hybrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team thatâs fully remote, split across timezones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one, absolutely. In this environment, I as a manager, can hire the best person for the job regardless of where they sit in 
the world. It doesn't matter if we could car pool to an office or if you are 18 hours ahead of me. This is the massive advantage of a 
fully remote workforce and is commonly brushed under the rug in these types of articles. A team that is aligned and has the best 
people in the world or industry working for them is going to crush a team of that is colocated and is limited by who lives in 
commuting distance or is willing to relocate to commuting distance of the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, this quote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look for software engineers finds that SF has about 40 times more than Miami: (and my hunch is that theyâre better ones too)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Every engineer here should be offended by this. I've hired over 100 engineers in my career. I think I have a pretty good idea 
of how it works, how these engineers perform, and how they behave. Purely from an economic stand point, hiring from the Bay Area 
is expensive. "But your engineers don't live in the Bay Area, Andy, you just said you hire globally." True...now, tell 
that engineer in Miami or London or Ankara or Sao Paulo or anywhere else why they are making at least $100k less a year than 
their coworker doing the exact same thing and see how quickly engineering morale crumbles. Or, are you one of the minority of 
companies that pay the same regardless of location? If not, you should be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best engineers I've worked with, except one, have been located well outside of the Bay Area. An engineer in Miami can do the exact
same work that an engineer in San Fransisco can at the same quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote works can and is incredibly successful for many companies. It does require deliberate, intentional, company decisions to make 
it work though. I shared the &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/"&gt;TeamOps&lt;/a&gt; information above (and completed &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-teamops-certification.html"&gt;TeamOps certification&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year). GitLab, one 
of the largest successful all remote companies in the world, has intentionally built their remote policies around this. Without
putting in the time or effort to ensure remote is successful, teams will (and are) defaulting back to in office. I think we are 
going to be seeing just how unsuccessful that strategy is in the next decade. One of the few benefits of Covid was that it showed
many engineers around the world just how much they are missing out on with daily commutes, 10-12 hour days in the office, 
lack of family time which is why there has been such push back. Those that have successfully adapted (or built from the 
ground up) the company culture to handle remote work will have a huge advantage as this period of contraction eases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job search"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>The Launch of Viva Printworks</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/launch-viva-printworks.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-05-21T01:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-21T01:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-05-21:/launch-viva-printworks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The start of a new project is always exciting.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last venture into Unreal Engine where &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/make-unreal5-2d-platformer-review.html"&gt;I built a simple 2D platformer&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to continue learning about blue prints,
but take a set of lessons that would be relatively quick. I found a great course for that in Yu Fujishiro's 
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ue5-procedural-vfx-motion-graphics/"&gt;Unreal Engine 5 | Generative Motion Graphics / VFX&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is billed as an hour and a half course that will help the learner gain comfort in using the Unreal Engine as an art
and design tool. Here's the result of my work from this course, and I am happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vTW2w9IHRVE"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hour and a half estimated time is slightly misleading, as the instructor is approaching the course expecting that the 
student has some experience. Fortunately, the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/tag/unreal-engine.html"&gt;handful of Unreal Engine courses&lt;/a&gt; I've taken since last year were enough for 
me to feel comfortable in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first "5 minute" section of the course depends on that knowledge (and your ability to Google) to set up and configure the project.
It's not difficult. I will save you a bit of time on one step though. This minute and a half &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBx0a6rNgvI"&gt;video on installing the DLSS plugin&lt;/a&gt; 
was more useful than pages of text from NVidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, it's onto the course material. The instructor is clear about the what and the why we are doing things.
I appreciated the explaination of small bits of logic and the migration from hard coded sections to more dynamic blue prints. It 
was a good way to introduce a concept and the same type of thing I've done when teaching beginners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one issue with my blue print logic that the instructor didn't seem to have. I'm not sure if it's due to different versions
of the engine. I was using 5.1.1 and I believe they were using 5.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cube Material Emission not equal to 0" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/cube_material_emission.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that emission node down on the lower left? In the course, the instructor has this set to a default of &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;. If I left this at 
&lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;, my cubes were all black. They'd start with the color I selected, but on the first split the children would be black cubes
instead of the expected shifting hue of colors. I couldn't figure out what I did wrong, but adjusting the default solved my
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other oddness - at least to me - was the process of exporting a high quality render. In a previous course I 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-beginners-building-environment-review.html"&gt;exported a video as MP4&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that through Google and a plugin. This course exports as an EXR file format. I've never
utilized this before so was initially confused by the giant dump of individual files I received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/davinci-resolve-beginner-advanced-review.html"&gt;DaVinci Resolve (and the course I took on it)&lt;/a&gt; can handle this without problems. This is how I created the 
video show casing my work above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was short and sweet. It took me approximately two and a half hours to get through. This accounts for environment set up,
playing around with various colors and values to make the composition unique, and the emission bug I mentioned above. I was looking 
for a short course that focused on a single "thing" and was pleased with how this turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few things that I didn't like were the assumption that the students had experience. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but
the instructor does reference "previous courses" a handful of times but they only have this course on Udemy at the time of publishing
this post. Another negative was the instructor's push of a paid for Unreal Plugin. This was for electronic wires, versus the curvy 
ones from the image above. The electronic wires allow for a more compact blue print - which I can see being valuable in a very large
project like the 2D Platformer - but in a short course it does cause the wires the overlap and can be difficult to follow. It also
costs an additional $13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was an entertaining course and I am happy with the output I produced. It was very satisfying the first time I pressed
play and watched my cube split, flash, lauch a few small sparks, and repeat. I recommend this course for someone with a basic 
Unreal Engine experience and a few hours to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a portion of late summer/early fall 2022 learning a little bit about Unreal Engine 5. I reviewed a course 
covering &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-realistic-environment-design-beginner.html"&gt;designing a realistic landscape environment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-beginners-building-environment-review.html"&gt;designing a realistic cabin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-complete-beginners-course.html"&gt;building a small game&lt;/a&gt;. 
Each of these furthered my interest in learning more about Unreal Engine and everything is capable of doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing to learn about in my Unreal journey was blueprints. You can build an entire game without writing code, and
I wanted to learn more about how to accomplish this. I selected &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-make-a-2d-platformer-in-unreal-engine/"&gt;"Learn How To Make A 2D Platformer In Unreal Engine 5"&lt;/a&gt; by
Uisco Dev to take this next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick spoiler before you get further down - the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of this course was pretty good. The demo I have below shows 
what I was able to accomplish following along with this course. The &lt;em&gt;presentation&lt;/em&gt; of this course was frustrating and 
an excersice in patience to get through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the review...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="negative-aspects"&gt;Negative Aspects&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#negative-aspects" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is advertised as a 7 hour course. If you are following along, as I was, with the course on one monitor and the Unreal 
Engine development environment on another, it's going to take much longer than 7 hours. The reason for this is how the instructor
presents the course. It took me a month to get through the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the instructor is expecting students to watch the course and work in Unreal Engine at different times. There is a lot
of statements like "connect these two nodes", or "connect this to the new node" - which on the surface are relevant. What isn't 
noticed though, because you are rapidly clicking through the blue prints and attempting to keep up, is that the instructor has 
moved to another node or isn't explaining which output needs to be connected to the new node. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the you need to pause the video, rewind a few seconds to get oriented, and rewatch. Then you go back to Unreal Engine and 
replicate the change. But, you didn't pause the video so the instructor continued to move on while you were catching up and 
the process repeats multiple times in a 5 minute lesson. That five minute lesson quickly becomes a 20 minute lesson because of the 
constant shifts between the lecture and the course with few natural break points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="positive-aspects"&gt;Positive Aspects&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#positive-aspects" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of this course is really good. I mentioned above that I wanted to learn about blue prints and this course did a great 
job of showing how powerful blue prints are. It also provided an eye opening overview of how "simple" things are more complex under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple coin pick up system involve setting up a sprite, checking for collision and ensure it's the player and not an enemy, adding
the coin to the player's count of coins and doing something if you collect enough coins. Conceptually, I knew all the happened, but 
setting it up showed just how much goes into the small aspects. Setting up a player or an enemey that will fight and interact with 
the environment is even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed learning those aspects of simple game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another positive attribute of this course is the instructor interaction. The instructor has cultivated an environment of providing
answers and explaining &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the answer can be found or set up in the future. The is one of the most active Q&amp;amp;A sections on Udemy
that I've seen. This should be commended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the instructor has updated the course to account for differences in Unreal Versions. The course was originally developed
for Unreal Engine 5.0. I utilize 5.1 and appreciate that there are a handful of lectures - specifically during control set up - 
that show the differences between 5.0 and 5.1. While I was taking this course Epic released a preview version of 5.2. I imagine the
instructor will be adding lectures as appropriate to show differences with that version in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the presentation of this course was frustrating. On several occassions I considered stopping the course because
I was so frustrated with the constant pause, rewind, replay, repeat cycle. Normally, I enjoy getting through a section at a time in
a Udemy course and on many occassions here, I could barely get through a handful of lectures before I needed to stop for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the content of the course was very useful and I was learning. I would have appreciated some more "why" lectures but
those existed for the areas that I felt they were most appropriate. It's the useful content and that I was learning something that
would pull me back in after a day or two of being away from the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is my final result. Obviously, it's a bit basic, but for a month of work I'm rather proud of how it turned out. I am 
walking away from this with more understanding of how blueprints work and that was my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my two previous course reviews - the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-realistic-environment-design-beginner.html"&gt;beginners Unreal Engine course&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-realistic-environment-design-beginner.html"&gt;realistic environment course&lt;/a&gt; -
I presented a short YouTube clip of what I'd built. For both of those, I used &lt;a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve"&gt;DaVinci Resolve&lt;/a&gt; to quickly stitch together
a few clips. There was nothing fancy in those, but while doing it I was impressed at the shear number of options and capabilities that
DaVinci had available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take beginner course to learn some more about the product. Spoiler: I'm ever more impressed by Resolve and at the same
time know that I have learned only a tiny fraction of what it's true capabilties are. There is so much to learn about individual
sections of this product that a single course could (and probably is) dedicated to each of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before I can dive deep into the product, I wanted to get a broad overview of it. I also wanted to really edit something
using what I learned to get a good feel for the tool. I settled on &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/davinci-resolve-18/"&gt;DaVinci Resolve 2022: Beginner to Advanced in DaVinci 18&lt;/a&gt; by
Marius Manola on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a ten hour course that covers major areas of DaVinci Resolve 18. The instructor is opinionated on their workflow
and discourses devisions for that in a few places. The most notable on is avoiding the use of the "Cut" tab all together, and instead 
do all edits and cuts in the "Edit" tab. As a beginner, I am sure there is a reason for the "Cut" tab but this course does not dive into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other tabs are covered to varying depths. The two that are covered the most are "Edit" (taking a bulk of the time during project demonstrations)
and "Fusion". "Color" gets a section of lectures, but I felt this was more a demonstration of capabilites than an explaination of why something is 
occuring. To be fair to the author, I think they realize that their audience (ie. me) aren't professional editors or have color grading training or 
experience. Both of those are college degrees, I believe. The "Fairlight" tab (sound editing) gets even less of a mention than color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-good"&gt;The Good&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-good" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was approachable to me. My experience with Resolve was smashing a couple clips together and rendering a final video. After this course,
I now feel I can do that much more effectively, as well as introduce a few small effects and edits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is good at talking through what they are doing. I don't recall any &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl"&gt;"draw the rest of the owl"&lt;/a&gt; moments. This helped if I got lost while
poking through my own instead of Resolve, instead of just watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is using DaVinci Resolve 18, which at the time I took the couse was the most recent version. I had a minor release update, but many other 
courses I saw on Udemy were for older versions of Resolve. One of the things I didn't like about the Unreal courses what that the instructor used early access or beta versions of the tool, while I was utilizing a full release, so the UI was not always the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working through the project was educational. My version didn't turn out exactly like the instructor's did and I think that's a good thing here. As a
creative process, editing a video is going to be different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-bad"&gt;The Bad&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-bad" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, there were a few areas that I thought could use better editing. A handful of times the instructor would demonstrate a new feature and it 
wouldn't work as expected. They'd redo it and it'd work. The first attempt would be vaguly glossed over and the instructor would move on. I think
the failure would have been removed from the lecture, with a minimiumal impact on understanding of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects we did involved a lot of watching the instructor click around the screen while the student was, theorectially, following along. I think this
was not the right way to present the project walk throughs. I found myself pausing the video a lot so that I could attempt something on my 
own project. I'd understand the idea for the current task and then move ahead. Eventually, I'd complete what I was working on  and restart the video only
to find out that the next several minutes in the walkthrough were roughly what I just did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the lecture at the same time I was focusing on my project wasn't possible. I think a better way to present this would be been a short 
instruction section showing the skill we'd be using, and then letting the student perform that task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor loves jump cuts in the projects. A lot of jump cuts. I wish we'd been able to cover a bit more about transitioning between shots or 
advancing the visual story. However, I suspect that's more of a filming technique that was out of scope for this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-ugly"&gt;The Ugly&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-ugly" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor is using a computer with a loud system fan and no noise canceling. It's very obvious when the computer is struggling because the fan noise
gets louder. For a while I thought it was either my computer (it wasn't) or my headphones (again, it wasn't). My suggestion to the author is to apply a bit of noise cancelation to the frequency your fan operates it, because with headphones it is very clear that the fan is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this course to be a great introduction to DaVinci Resolve. While my first project isn't going to win any awards, it's important to remember 
that it's my first project. I can already think of several other projets I can use Resolve for and I feel comfortable using it for these personal
 projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The areas that weren't extensively covered feel like great next steps, and not "the instructor didn't have time to do this". I mentioned it above,
but I suspect these areas (and the ones that were covered) could be their own course or set of courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got what I wanted out of the course, and perhaps a little more. The instructor did a good job covering the material, demonstrating the tooling
while building the projects, and expressing opinions on workflow which I think are helpful to someone new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado...my first video edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0UiZtcf7AM"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My self assessment of this video is that it feels like a novice edited it. (Surprise! I'm a novice at this). I'm not a fan of all of the 
jump cuts. It gets..."jarring" is perhaps the best way to describe it. But, this was the editing style the instructor went with. I've love to learn about other options so that it feels less jarring.&lt;/p&gt;

This post covers my recent work to find links that have broken so that I can fix them quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months or so, I've been making changes to the site. This culminated in November with a theme update
and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/relaunch-personal-site.html"&gt;site relaunch&lt;/a&gt;. I have a couple more articles planned about things I've learned from that relaunch, started with today's
article. The site is &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/archives.html"&gt;over a decade old&lt;/a&gt;, with the initial article in 2009, with over 100 posts since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade plus is a long time to assume that links will remain operational. I wrote a short series of articles about how 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;broken links impacted Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; over 7 years ago, including a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;proposal to fix it&lt;/a&gt; and how I performed the 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/link-analysis---technical-explanation.html"&gt;link checking from a technical perspective&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I want to make sure that I don't have dead links all over &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; site,
especially because this is the site I give out in a professional context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-action"&gt;GitHub Action&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#github-action" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Github Action script, is &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content/e701da303592695bc6300f155be56d79ca35957d/.github/workflows/check-broken-links.yml"&gt;available in the repository&lt;/a&gt; where the content of this blog is kept. It's in the &lt;code&gt;.github/workflow/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="scheduling"&gt;Scheduling&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal for this project was to check links for the entire site on a regular basis. I was hoping roughly once a week. Fortunately,
GitHub Actions allow you to &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule"&gt;schedule your actions&lt;/a&gt;, using syntax like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'12 1 * * 5'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing to note, which is called out in the docs, is that &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is a special character in YAML, so the string 
has to be quoted. Using this schedule, my link checks will run every Friday at 1:12am. For me, timezone doesn't matter, but the
documentation says this is going to be UTC time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="checking-links"&gt;Checking links&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#checking-links" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing that has to happen is the actual checking of the links. I use &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/broken-link-checker"&gt;broken-link-checker&lt;/a&gt; for now. I picked this because 
I'm familiar with it. It hasn't been updated since 2018, though, so in the future I may spend some time either looking for an 
alternative or building an alternative. For the time being though, it works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this snippet into my actions file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Broken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Checker&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;npx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;broken-link-checker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;WEBSITE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--ordered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--recursive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--user-agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;linkedin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"udemy"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ude.my"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"eia.gov"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"backpack.tf"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;hlsw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;dell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;supermicro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$WEBSITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; variable that I define as &lt;code&gt;https://andrewwegner.com/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set up a &lt;code&gt;user-agent&lt;/code&gt; because several sites block the default one. I did something similar in my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/link-analysis---technical-explanation.html"&gt;Stack Overflow analysis 7 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of those &lt;code&gt;excludes&lt;/code&gt; are due to those specific domains still not allowing automatic scraping. It's a little disappointing that I need these, but excluding these few to ensure the rest are functional is more important to me than trying to figure out a work around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-an-issue"&gt;Create an issue&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#create-an-issue" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If broken links are found, it doesn't do me any good to have that buried in a log somewhere without alerts. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
I don't check Github every day. My goal was to create an issue on the repository if broken links were found. I did that using the following, and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-an-issue"&gt;Create an issue action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uses:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;actions/checkout@v3
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;if:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;failure()

-&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uses:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;JasonEtco/create-an-issue@v2
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;env:
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secrets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;}
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;with:
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;filename:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ISSUE_TEMPLATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;}
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;if:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;failure()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important line here is the &lt;code&gt;filename:&lt;/code&gt; line. Using another environment variable, I defined a file with my issue template. 
Everytime an issue is created by the action, it will have the same format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="issue-template"&gt;Issue Template&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#issue-template" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content/master/.github/workflows/check-broken-links.md"&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; is defined in the same directory as my workflow and currently looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Broken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Links&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;assignees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;## Broken Links Detected&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Broken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Checker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;broken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//andrewwegner.com&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content/actions/workflows/check-broken-links.yml)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;_Use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BROKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;â`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;highlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;failures_&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top metadata defines the issue title, and any labels or assignees I want to set up. I'll probably add myself as an assignee
once I'm happy with the stability and reliablity of the checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see what an &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content/issues/5"&gt;issue created with this template looks like in the repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="environment-variables"&gt;Environment Variables&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#environment-variables" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last section, I've alluded to already - the environment variables. I have two currently defined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WEBSITE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://andrewwegner.com/"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ISSUE_TEMPLATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;".github/workflows/check-broken-links.md"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is to set the domain I'm scanning. Mine, obviously. The second is a link to the issue template that is utilized if broken links
are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="things-i-learned"&gt;Things I learned&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#things-i-learned" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While setting this up there where a few things that I learned or desired that were not immediately obvious while reading documentation. The first
was that GitHub actions aren't triggerable without setting up the appropriate &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; event type. In this case, I want to occassionally
run the link checker on command, instead of once a week. That means I need the &lt;code&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; event and it needs to be empty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on:
    schedule:
      - cron:  '12 1 * * 5'
    workflow_dispatch:
  env:
    WEBSITE_URL: "https://andrewwegner.com/"
    ISSUE_TEMPLATE: ".github/workflows/check-broken-links.md"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the empty &lt;code&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; has no other parameters. It can accept some, if I wanted to provide input to the script at run time,
but I have no need for that right now. So, mine remains empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple nice to haves, that I wasn't able to immediately figure out were how to retry a failed link "later" in the script. While testing
the functionality, I had a run that failed because one image, in one article failed. Checking that article showed that it worked. Checking the 
log showed that the link being checked worked. It was just the internet being the internet with a temporary blip. I'd love to be able to retry failed
linked a little later in the run or X seconds later, etc. If it fails both times, assume it's broken and report it as normal. Without that retry,
I'm a little worried this is going to be fragile, which is part of why I haven't populated the &lt;code&gt;assignee&lt;/code&gt; metadata in the template yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice to have would be a way to embed the broken links (and page they appear on) in the issue itself. I couldn't find a way to accomplish
that with the current tooling, so the template links to the log and you have to search for the appropriate string. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned earlier, I will likely look for a more up to date tool. Or build one my own. I'm interested in learning more about how GitHub actions 
work and this may be a good usecase for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="technical"/><category term="Pelican"/><category term="meta"/></entry><entry><title>CoderByte assessments fall to ChatGPT</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-beats-more-interview-assessments.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-02-04T23:30:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-04T23:30:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-02-04:/chatgpt-beats-more-interview-assessments.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;CoderByte falls to ChatGPT just like the more well known interview assessment platforms. Here's my run down, and how I used ChatGPT to solve an easy, medium and hard problem in less than 5 minutes total.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I'll be evaluating &lt;a href="https://coderbyte.com/developers"&gt;CoderByte&lt;/a&gt; and their publicly posted challenges against ChatGPT. I selected an easy, a medium and the single hard
question from their list of &lt;a href="https://coderbyte.com/challenges"&gt;open challenges&lt;/a&gt; and ran those through ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous articles in this series, I've shown how &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; can easily solve interview assessments from &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/breaking-the-interview-with-chatgpt.html"&gt;TestGorilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-breaks-more-interview-questions.html"&gt;CodeSignal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-continues-beating-interview-questions.html"&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/solving-more-interview-questions-with-chatgpt.html"&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;[hackerrankg]. I've said it in 
those articles, but I'll say it again: Companies need to evaluate their engineering candidates - all candidates, actually - apprpriately 
when they are hiring. Your engineers are using many tools to do their jobs and AI Tooling is one of the newest tools on the market. Removing 
a tool from your engineers is going to make them less efficient, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; testing your candidates on how they use these tools is 
going to mean you hire someone that had not fully demonstrated their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT should be treated as a tool, but it's also helpful to think of it as a junior level engineer. You need to check it's work. 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html"&gt;ChatGPT is known to be inaccurate&lt;/a&gt;, which is why it remains &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;banned on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few instances where
I had to do that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First a disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I was Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven Teams&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Prior to that, 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html"&gt;I was a customer of Woven for over two years&lt;/a&gt;. I do not remember CoderByte being mentioned during my tenure and CoderByte does not 
seem to consider Woven a competitor, as Woven isn't listed as an &lt;a href="https://coderbyte.com/organizations#pricing"&gt;alternative on their pricing FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="easy-react-button-toggle"&gt;Easy - React Button Toggle&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#easy-react-button-toggle" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I've tried to be mostly random in my selection of assessments during these tests, I intentionally selected this react 
assessment because I don't know react. I've liked these types of assessment questions in the previous articles because I means I can't 
apply my experience to "nudge" ChatGPT toward a solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge here is to toggle a button between "On" and "Off". You're presented with a very small amount of boiler plate code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply copy/pasted the prompt and the template into ChatGPT. It sent back this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'react-dom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;setToggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;setToggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ON'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'OFF'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'root'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied that into the IDE provided by CoderByte and submitted the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Easy Challenge - React Toggle Button Score" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-easy-tests.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test took two minutes to complete. The bulk of that time was spot checking that ChatGPT didn't mess with the boiler plate code to badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Easy Challenge - React Toggle Button Time Taken" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-easy-minutes.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting this about the results is that even with the 10/10, the system says it only scored higher than 12% of other users. Does this mean
that only 12% of the users passing this assessment are getting lower than a 10/10? To me, that's the sign of a bad assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Easy Challenge - React Toggle Button Score comparison" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-easy-scores.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="medium-sql-member-count"&gt;Medium - SQL Member Count&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#medium-sql-member-count" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medium challenge I selected was an SQL question. SQL is interesting, in my experience, in that the results returned on an assessment are a 
lot more uniform compared to a non-SQL coding assessment. This one wasn't a difficult one with joins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this assessment was to return a list of names in alphabetical order, a count of the number of people that report to them, and the 
average age of their team members. I pasted the prompt, the expected table layout for the output and the table layout being selected from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first response was &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;AVG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Average_Age&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;maintable_YTTQH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where experience, and checking the results are important. The expected output showed that the average age should be an integer. It also showed that the average age column should be named &lt;code&gt;Average Age&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code&gt;Average_Age&lt;/code&gt; (notice the lack of the underscore). I provided this guidance to ChatGPT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AVG(Age) should be an integer not a float and The "Average_Age" field should be "Average Age" without an underscore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It corrected both problems with a new query which I submitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ROUND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;AVG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Average Age"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;maintable_YTTQH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReportsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Medium Challenge - SQL Score" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-medium-tests.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT scored another 10/10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Medium Challenge - SQL Time Taken" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-medium-minutes.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with that extra round trip with ChatGPT, it took less than a minute to complete this assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Medium Challenge - SQL Score Comparison" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-medium-scores.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assessment seems to have a slightly better split of user scores, which is progress I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hard-bracket-combinations"&gt;Hard - Bracket Combinations&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#hard-bracket-combinations" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one hard assessment available publicly. The goal for this assessment is to return the number of combinations you can make with a number 
of pairs of parenthesis. The example provided is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible combinations of 3 pairs of parenthesis, namely: ()()(), are ()()(), ()(()), (())(), ((())), and (()())&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied the prompt and boiler plate code into ChatGPT and it returned the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;BracketCombinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# keep this function call here &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BracketCombinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience here says that is odd. Technically speaking, Python will allow you to have that &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statemnet inside a function, but if I saw one of 
my developers do it, I'd mention it during a code review. I was curious though and submitted it as is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went back and told ChatGPT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write the function without importing &lt;code&gt;factorial&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It replied with this function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def BracketCombinations(num):
    def fact(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result &lt;span class="gs"&gt;*= i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gs"&gt;        return result&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gs"&gt;    return fact(2 *&lt;/span&gt; num) // (fact(num) * fact(num + 1))

&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; keep this function call here 
print(BracketCombinations(int(input())))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted this response too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only have one set of images for this challenge, because they both output &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same responses. Both solutions scored the same. Both solutions 
were better than 35.1% of other users. Both solutions had an &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt; complexity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Hard Challenge - Combination Score and Complexity" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-hard-tests-runtime.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing the complexity is a nice touch. I will admit that I was expecting the solution that imported &lt;code&gt;factorial&lt;/code&gt; to be rejected because it's using a 
built in function instead of rolling your own. Good for CoderByte for allowing a developer to use the built in libraries as an engineer would do in 
a production environment, instead of adding a false constraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CoderByte - Hard Challenge - Combination Time Taken" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/coderbyte-hard-solution-solve-time.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy pasting to CoderByte kept this close to a minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another code only assessment tool has been shown to be ineffective. The one thing this one does, that others does show publicly, is the 
time it took to solve a problem. I'm very surprised that a majority of these were solved in under ten minutes. Even so, solving a problem in 
less than a minute will probably raise a flag of some kind for a hiring manager giving this type of assessment. I guarentee that time is visbile 
to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three assessments show how well ChatGPT can be in being your virtual junior engineer. With the react question, I have no idea if it's 
the more efficient way to solve the problem but it works. With the SQL question, experience identified two small problems and allowed me to 
provide feedback and get a corrected query in seconds. The third question turned in two different ways of solving the problem. Apparently, according
to CoderByte, bother of which perform exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total time it took me to run these three tests was under five minutes. That's a great tool to have in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="job search"/><category term="chatgpt"/><category term="ai interviews"/></entry><entry><title>Review of GitLab's 'TeamOps Certification' course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-teamops-certification.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-02-02T23:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-02T23:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-02-02:/gitlab-teamops-certification.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've passed GitLab's TeamOps certification course. This is a review of the course.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over two years ago, I took &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-manage-remote-team.html"&gt;GitLab's course on how to manage a remote team&lt;/a&gt;. That was a very useful course
and I was able to apply several best practices from that course to my role at the time, plus roles I've held since then.
I continue to manage global and remote teams, so I was excited to hear about GitLab's newest course covering their
&lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/"&gt;"TeamOps"&lt;/a&gt; model of improving teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is hosted on &lt;a href="https://levelup.gitlab.com/catalog"&gt;LevelUp&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of 9 public course they have available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TeamOps Certification course is split into 5 sections and covers about 2-3 hours of material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first section covers the foundations of TeamOps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remaining four sections cover the 4 guiding principles of TeamOps&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared Reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone Contributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision Velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement Clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the welcome message in the first lesson, this course is entirely text based. I was surprised by this because of the 
previous course from GitLab and the extensive use of video on how to manage a remote team. This course does have a 6-7 question 
knowledge check at the end of each section and will not let you proceed if you score below an 80%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the questions are easy - assuming you comprehend what you are reading and not just clicking through to the next page. 
The course also provides access to the updated &lt;a href="https://learn.gitlab.com/allremote#page=1"&gt;The Remote Playbook&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great starting point for checking your company's
remote processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TeamOps felt like a good extension and refresher from the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-manage-remote-team.html"&gt;"How to Manage a Remote Team" course&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, that's all it felt 
like - a refresher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change from video to text based courses was surprising, and slightly unwelcome. The content of the course is good, and will definately 
help teams improve how they operate. However, many of the same ideas were covered in the previous course. I suppose that if this continues
to work for GitLab, it makes sense that they aren't trying to make sweeping changes, but I was hoping for...more, I suppose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this course to anyone who manages a team remotely and needs a refresher from the previous course GitLab provided or doesn't have
the recommended 11 hours for that course. This should take about an hour and a half to read through. If, however, you have more time I think the 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-manage-remote-team.html"&gt;"How to Manage a Remote Team" course&lt;/a&gt; course has even more information that will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

This article talks about the challenges I faced updating to a new version of PHP for a modern version of NextCloud.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost five years ago, after a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/backup-your-data.html"&gt;personal data disaster&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/new-house-server.html"&gt;set up a new server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-nextcloud.html"&gt;set up NextCloud on it&lt;/a&gt;. Then later in the year
I updated Ubuntu to 18.04 from 16.04. Since initial install, I had gone from version 12 to version 23 on PHP 7.3. I documented the steps I took 
to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/updating-php-ubuntu-1804.html"&gt;upgrade from PHP7.1 to PHP7.3 for NextCloud&lt;/a&gt; in another article. With &lt;a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/24/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html"&gt;NextCloud version 24&lt;/a&gt;, PHP7.3 was no longer supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant it was time to update PHP again, and I had hoped to follow a similar process as before. It was pretty similar, as I tend to keep the 
server updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="disabling-php-73"&gt;Disabling PHP 7.3&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#disabling-php-73" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to ensure I had at least PHP 7.4 installed. Since I'd be moving to &lt;a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/25/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html"&gt;NextCloud 25&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to ensure that I had at least PHP 8.0,
as PHP 7.4 had been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing here is that I don't have PHP 8.1 installed. Not 100% sure why, but right now that doesn't bother me. Since the documentation
doesn't mention PHP 8.2 support, I'll be using PHP 8.0 support, and cleaning up the old versions later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable Apache's PHP 7.3 module and enable the 8.0 one, then restart Apache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo a2dismod php7.3
sudo a2enmod php8.0
sudo service apache2 restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="adjusting-php-80s-memory-limit"&gt;Adjusting PHP 8.0's memory limit&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-php-80s-memory-limit" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextCloud recommends a 512M PHP memory limit. I forgot to do this initially and got stuck in the web updater. Fortunately, this is an easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your &lt;code&gt;php.ini&lt;/code&gt; and adjust the &lt;code&gt;memory_limit&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;512M&lt;/code&gt;. Restart Apache once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;code&gt;php.ini&lt;/code&gt; was located here: &lt;code&gt;/etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fixing-the-stuck-updater"&gt;Fixing the stuck updater&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-the-stuck-updater" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started the update with a bad memory limit, the update wasn't able to complete. NextCloud failed the Verification step (Step 5) and 
attempting to restart it resulted in &lt;code&gt;Step 5 is currently in process. Please reload this page later&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this, is to remove the &lt;code&gt;.step&lt;/code&gt; file from your &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; directory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm /nextcloud/data/updater-XXXXXXX/.step
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;XXXXXXX&lt;/code&gt; appears to be randomly generated, so you will need to see what yours is named. Once that file was removed, I was able to complete
the updates through the web updater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fix-missing-indexes"&gt;Fix missing indexes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#fix-missing-indexes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step in this process - which is really part of all NextCloud updates - was to get indexes in place. This is easily accomplished by running
the &lt;code&gt;occ&lt;/code&gt; utility provide by NextCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your NextCloud directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo -u www-data php8.0 ./occ db:add-missing-indices
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm running this as the correct user. If you don't, it will warn you and fail to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update was pretty similar to the one I did several years ago. The important thing that I missed was setting up the &lt;code&gt;memory_limit&lt;/code&gt;. A small 
problem to resolve. I think between this upgrade and the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/updating-php-ubuntu-1804.html"&gt;previous upgrade&lt;/a&gt;, the future upgrade to PHP 8.2 when it's required will be even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 years of using NextCloud to save family data, I continue to love it's simplicity and ability to "just work". Less technical family members 
don't need to do anything complicated to have their data backed up to a location we control. This update will ensure it continues to work with the 
newest versions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>ChatGPT easily solves HackerRank questions</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/solving-more-interview-questions-with-chatgpt.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-01-08T01:15:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-08T01:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-01-08:/solving-more-interview-questions-with-chatgpt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;HackerRank is a common tool companies use in interviews.

&lt;p&gt;It's important that companies evaluate their engineering candidates appropriately when they are hiring. Do other areas of your company 
evaluate their potential hires by restricting access to tools they'll use to perform the job? I suspect not. Why do the same to 
your software engineers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Tooling - things like GitHub's &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; and now &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; - are &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; that your engineers can use to do their job. During the hiring 
process, engineers should be evaluated on the skills they have, and that includes the ability to utilize all available tools. I expect AI
assistance to be come as common place as using Stack Overflow to solve a problem. ChatGPT, Copilot, and any future tools doing similar tasks are 
going to be used frequently in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'm testing &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; against one of the most popular coding assessment services: &lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;. I've already covered other assessment services like &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/breaking-the-interview-with-chatgpt.html"&gt;TestGorilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-breaks-more-interview-questions.html"&gt;CodeSignal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-continues-beating-interview-questions.html"&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt; in this series. I recommend taking a look at those too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the engineers that have found this post and are looking for solutions to your coding assessments, I want to warn you, ChatGPT is an
&lt;em&gt;assistant&lt;/em&gt;. Think of it as a junior level engineer. You may need to check it's work. &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html"&gt;ChatGPT is known to be inaccurate&lt;/a&gt;, which is why 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;it was banned on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. Don't take it's responses as gospel. Evaluate the responses and make improvements as needed. You'll see I 
had to do that a couple of times with the questions below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First a disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I was Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven Teams&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Prior to that, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html"&gt;I was a customer of Woven for over two years&lt;/a&gt;. 
HackerRank is mentioned multiple times in the Woven blog and is a competitor to Woven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final note before I begin, HackerRank presented a couple annoyances during this test because they use LaTeX formatting in their prompts. Simply 
copy and pasting prompts to ChatGPT was not possible, because key parts of the problem would be missing. This meant that I 
spent several minutes per prompt cleaning it up and reinserting the LaTeX characters in plain text. This accounts for the higher solve 
times compared to the competing services in other articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="triangle-quest"&gt;Triangle Quest&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#triangle-quest" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selected a random Medium difficulty Python question for my first prompt: &lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-quest-1/problem?isFullScreen=true"&gt;Triangle Quest&lt;/a&gt;. This one was unique in this series of tests. 
The expected solution was to add only a single line of code and I could only use arithmetic operations, a single &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop and &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackerRank - Triangle Quest Prompt" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/hackerrank-triangle-prompt.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, there were a few LaTeX things to clean up, but then ChatGPT returned a single line of code to add to the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop provided.
The whole code is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in range(1,int(input())): #More than 2 lines will result in 0 score. Do not leave a blank line also
    print((i &lt;span class="gs"&gt;* (10 *&lt;/span&gt;* i - 1)) // 9)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted the code and passed all test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackerRank - Triangle Quest Results" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/hackerrank-triange-result.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by this one. I was expecting to encounter some problems with the constraint of only being able to use arithemtic operations. It 
turns out, ChatGPT caught that constraint and solved the problem without any issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iterables-and-iterators"&gt;Iterables and Iterators&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#iterables-and-iterators" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try another Medium difficulty problem, that added more than a single line of code. The constraints on the previous question put 
the problem well into "puzzle" territory, and I am not a fan of puzzles in technical interviews. The second medium question selected was 
&lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/iterables-and-iterators/problem?isFullScreen=true"&gt;Iterables and Iterators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackerRank - Iterables and Iterators Prompt" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/hackerrank-iterables-prompt.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first result returned didn't take input. Instead, it hard coded values like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# given list of letters
letters = ['a', 'a', 'c', 'd']

# number of indices to select
k = 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing with this solution was that it ignored the first input row - 
"The first line contains the integer N, denoting the length of the list". I don't disagree with this change. We should be able to determine the length 
of the list from the list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the solution required taking input from STDIN, so I let ChatGPT know this by pasting in the only bit of information provided in the 
code here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT made the neccessary change and provided a new code block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;itertools&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# read input from stdin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# number of combinations of indices&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;total_combinations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itertools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;combinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# number of combinations of indices that do not contain the letter 'a'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;combinations_without_a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;itertools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;combinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# probability that none of the selected indices contain the letter 'a'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;probability_without_a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;combinations_without_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_combinations&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# probability that at least one of the selected indices contain the letter 'a'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;probability_with_a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;probability_without_a&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# print the probability to three decimal places&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{:.3f}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;probability_with_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted this code and it also passed each of the test cases. This solution also ignored using the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; input, but did accept it as input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackerRank - Iterables and Iterators Results" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/hackerrank-iterables-result.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="validating-postal-codes"&gt;Validating Postal Codes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#validating-postal-codes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I've shown that ChatGPT can do medium level problems. So, I selected a Hard problem: &lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-postalcode/problem?isFullScreen=true"&gt;Validating Postal Codes&lt;/a&gt;. 
The intersting constraint on this one is that &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements aren't allowed. The goal here is to provide two regular expressions to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've built some nasty regular expressions over the years. I've talked about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; in the past, and it's role in removing spam from 
the Stack Exchange network. It is built on regular expressions. Lots and lots of regular expressions. So, I felt pretty comfortable with 
this question and wanted to see how ChatGPT would handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackerRank - Validating Postal Codes Prompt" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/hackerrank-postal-prompt.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second regular expression, the alternating repeating digit pair, didn't work the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;'(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;\d)\d\1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that know regular expressions, that is not going to work. I pointed this out and it corrected itself, and explained the meaning of the
new regular expression. The two final regular expressions are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;regex_integer_in_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"^[1-9]\d{5}$"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'r'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"(\d)(?=\d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'r'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is using a positive lookahead assertion, which ChatGPT explains as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This regular expression will match any digit &lt;code&gt;(\d)&lt;/code&gt; followed by another digit, with the same digit &lt;code&gt;(\1)&lt;/code&gt; appearing immediately after that. The &lt;code&gt;(?=...)&lt;/code&gt; syntax is a positive lookahead assertion, which means that it will only match a digit if it is followed by the specified pattern, but the pattern will not be included in the overall match. The parentheses around &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt; capture the digit so that it can be referred to as &lt;code&gt;\1&lt;/code&gt; later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted the two regexes above, and passed the test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackerRank - Validating Postal Codes Result" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/hackerrank-postal-result.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of my time on these was spent cleaning up the LaTeX formatting. I mentioned a few prompt clarifications needed to solve problems in the 
returned code too - one required accepting user input and the other was an invalid regular expression. Pointing this out to ChatGPT got the 
problem resolved immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the type of thing that I'd expect an engineer to need to do with the AI assistant (or more junior engineer). Hiring processes
must adapt to the existance of AI assistants. Evaluate your candidates and their ability to do more than simply write code. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="job search"/><category term="chatgpt"/><category term="ai interviews"/></entry><entry><title>Taking Codility's sample interview exam using ChatGPT</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-continues-beating-interview-questions.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-01-05T01:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-05T01:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-01-05:/chatgpt-continues-beating-interview-questions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm continuing my look at technical interview exam questions, this time with Codility, and using ChatGPT to show the process needs to change&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was announced on January 3, 2023 that &lt;a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/3/23537987/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt-writing-artificial-intelligence"&gt;New York City has banned students and teachers from using ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, because of "concerns about negative 
impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content". This continues the daily news stories 
about &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; that have come out over the past several weeks. I suspect that 2023 is going to be a massive year for public 
awareness of "AI". Especially with GPT-4's expected release in a month or so. In the meantime, 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;ChatGPT remains banned over on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html"&gt;accuracy of ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; was also mentioned by New 
York City in their banning of the tool in the school system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My perspective is that this is a tool that software engineers can utilize, but they have to understand that it is just that - a tool. It is 
only as good as the engineer that wields it. A good engineer will be able to utilize it very effectively. Hiring managers need to be aware of 
what this tool is capable of, though. I've already shown that it can easily solve common interview questions that the software industry uses
in their hiring process. I showed that questions from &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/breaking-the-interview-with-chatgpt.html"&gt;TestGorilla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-breaks-more-interview-questions.html"&gt;CodeSignal&lt;/a&gt; are easily solved by this tool in 
previous articles in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm going to look at another service, similar to these: &lt;a href="https://www.codility.com/"&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt;. Much like CodeSignal, Codility sits on both sides of the interview
process. It has a developer facing set of challenges and learning material. It also sells services to companies seeking to streamline a portion
of their hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First a disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I was Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven Teams&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Prior to that, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html"&gt;I was a customer of Woven for over two years&lt;/a&gt;. 
Woven is a competitor of Codility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question in this post is taken from &lt;a href="https://app.codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/"&gt;Codility's sample test&lt;/a&gt;. I will not be sharing the exact prompt from the sample test, as Codility has
a disclaimer in the prompt clearly stating that disclousure is prohibited. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be a shame if they hid all of their technical exam questions behind such a disclaimer though. Especially when this 
&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/51719848/189134"&gt;sample question sits on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; with over 400k views and has over 100 answers. It also generated it's own 
&lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/418024/189134"&gt;meta question&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one reason that these types of questions aren't great for technical interview questions. Exam questions will always escape the 
exam environment. A student, a job candidate, or someone interested in the content will be able to find it and the answers after it's out
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the full prompt, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/51719848/189134"&gt;Stack Overflow question&lt;/a&gt;. But, briefly, the problem to solve is to find the 
smallest positve integer that does not appear in an array of numbers. We are provided three sample arrays with positive, negative and duplicate entires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copy and pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and got a short function back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def solution(A):
    # Create a set of all the positive integers in the list
    positive_int_set = set([x for x in A if x &amp;gt; 0])

    # Iterate through the positive integers, starting at 1
    i = 1
    while i in positive_int_set:
        i += 1

    # Return the first integer that is not in the set
    return i
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pasted this back into the testing environment and ran the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Compilation successful.

Example test:   [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]
OK

Example test:   [1, 2, 3]
OK

Example test:   [-1, -3]
OK

Your code is syntactically correct and works properly on the example test.
Note that the example tests are not part of your score. On submission at least 8 test cases not shown here will assess your solution.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built in test cases worked as expected. After I submitted the code, I need to wait about 5 minutes for the hidden test cases to be processed and 
receive my results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Codility - Missing Integer Sample Test" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/codility-results.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed the 3 example test cases, 5 additional "correctness" test cases and 4 performance test cases. 100%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooray! ChatGPT wins again. Total time taken - 4 minutes (plus 5 minutes for Codility to do it's evaluation). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineers are smart individuals. They, generally, enjoy new technologies too. ChatGPT is a new technology that is going to be a valuable
tool in their future. GitHub has had &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. ChatGPT brings a new tool to the toolbelt. It should be expected by 
hiring managers that your current engineering team and engineers you hire will use such tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interview processes need to adapt to the existance of these tools. If you are asking a question that a simple tool can solve, are you 
really determining an engineer's ability? Do your counterparts ask someone in finanace to calculate a percentage and not expect the candidate 
to use, at least, a calculator? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring processes much adapt. Evaluate your candidates, especially the more experienced candidates, with something other than an exam question that 
their newest tool can solve. Your engineer is going to be doing more than writing code and implementing an algorithm. Evaluate &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; skills. Those 
are the ones you really need on your team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about the other common interview systems and how they perform against ChatGPT, read one of the articles in the series below.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="job search"/><category term="chatgpt"/><category term="ai interviews"/></entry><entry><title>Running CodeSignal questions through ChatGPT</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-breaks-more-interview-questions.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2023-01-01T17:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-01T17:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2023-01-01:/chatgpt-breaks-more-interview-questions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am going to examine four sample CodeSignal questions and show how ChatGPT solves the problems.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; has taken over a lot of technology news in the last month. Within days, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;Stack Overflow banned ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, due to 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html"&gt;subtle errors that the chatbot is prone to make&lt;/a&gt;. I've also written about how I hope that ChatGPT's existance will change 
the hiring processes in the technology industry, because of how easily it can solve &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/breaking-the-interview-with-chatgpt.html"&gt;TestGorilla&lt;/a&gt; technical interview
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm going to turn my attention to another company that does interview tests: &lt;a href="https://codesignal.com/developers/"&gt;CodeSignal&lt;/a&gt;. CodeSignal sits on both sides of the 
interview process, with a LeetCode style developer facing set of challenges. Solve problems, increase your score. It also sells services to
companies looking to outsource a portion of their hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First a disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I was Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven Teams&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Prior to that, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html"&gt;I was a customer of Woven for over two years&lt;/a&gt;. 
Woven is a competitor of CodeSignal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions in this post are taken from &lt;a href="https://codesignal.com/blog/engineering/example-codesignal-questions/"&gt;CodeSignal's blog&lt;/a&gt;, showing off four of their software engineering questions. CodeSignal provides an 
explaination of the question, and a sample response with a quick analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="array-manipulation"&gt;Array Manipulation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#array-manipulation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise! Another array question. I suppose it wouldn't be a generic software engineering interview without a question related to arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CodeSignal - Array Manipulation Prompt" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/codesignal-array.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that it covers a basic array traversal and manipulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small nitpick - depending on the hirnig process, this sentence can come across as condicending. Depending on where a technical interview fits 
in the process, it's possible that a non-engineer is the one that sees these results first. I would not count on my HR coworkers to understand
"basic array traversal and manipulation", because it's not part of their skillset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how ChatGPT does. I copy and pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and waited a few seconds for a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;If&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'s the first element, use 0 as the value for a[i - 1]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        if i == 0:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        b.append(0 + a[i] + a[i + 1])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        # If it'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i + 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i - 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Otherwise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i - 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i + 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i - 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i + 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't match the exact response that CodeSignal provides, but it functions with their test case. I am count that as a pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="string-pattern-matching"&gt;String Pattern Matching&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#string-pattern-matching" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common theme in these recent tests I've run is pattern matching. This one, however, at least is more interesting that others. It still 
doesn't seem to reflect a real world problem, and is just a puzzle, but at least it's more unique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CodeSignal - Pattern Matching" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/codesignal-pattern.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has the advantage of testing several fundamental programming skills at once: traversing multiple arrays with nested loops, working with subarrays, and performing basic collections/string operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still sitting in the "basic" tier here, so I suspect that ChatGPT will have no problem. Time to check that assumption by pasting the prompt to the
bot. One thing I did have to modify here is the exponents. They pasted as non-exponents, which would have messed up those constraints at the end. This 
will be a similar problem with a later question. I adjusted those lines slightly to make the numbers exponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the response back was: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;substrings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Iterate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;substrings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big difference between the response generated and the response provided, is that CodeSignal's response breaks out a portion of the code into
a second function. The ChatGPT response does everything in a single, larger, loop. Personally, I'd take off a point for not breaking this into 
another function. CodeSignal's response is better, but the ChatGPT one functions and passes the test. While the second function is a good idea,
not having it is not a deal breaker for me. This is especially true of a "basic" test, which is probably being used for less senior roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="two-dimensional-array-traversal"&gt;Two-Dimensional Array Traversal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#two-dimensional-array-traversal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're onto the harder questions. This is a long prompt, with multiple animated gifs, and is multiple pages of scrolling. I'm not going to 
paste the prompt here because the animation is important to understanding the algorithm that needs to be implemented. The general goal though is 
to build a very small scale Tetris board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Tetris-inspired question is challenging. Candidates will have to traverse and manipulate two-dimensional arrays in a non-conventional way. As itâs an advanced question, it tests how well an engineer can understand a complex set of constraints and proceed with a non-trivial implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my reading of the prompt, and looking at the solution logic, I agree. While this is still a puzzle type question, I don't recall seeing anything
like this previously. The uniqueness, yet similarity to a game that most engineers will know, makes the question interesting to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animated gifs are useful for a human to see what is expected in the solution, but shouldn't be need by ChatGPT, provided the prompt is descriptive
enough. Copying and pasted the text into ChatGPT, provides the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;If&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;full&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;formed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, test cases aren't provided for this one. However, looking at the two responses, there are a couple obvious differences. ChatGPT doesn't
handle the size of the board at all. CodeSignal uses this size in multiple places of their code. ChatGPT also uses &lt;code&gt;all()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;any()&lt;/code&gt; checks, where 
CodeSignal uses longer and more complicated &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements. Personally, I'd prefer the simiple &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements for readability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm unsure how to score this one without the test cases, but will note that ChatGPT failed CodeSignal's first sentence in the solution explaination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution starts by defining some dimensions that will be important for the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skeptical that without the size of the figure this will work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lookup-table"&gt;Lookup Table&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#lookup-table" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we get to a question with lookup tables. These types of problems can usually be solved via brute force, at the expense of performance. They
make good questions for a more senior developer. Note that this prompt also has exponents that I needed to adjust when pasting to the chat bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CodeSignal - Lookup Tables" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/codesignal-lookup.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question tests whether candidates have the problem-solving and data structures skills to use a lookup table (hash set/dictionary) in their programming language of choice. It also involves a bit of tricky logic to avoid double-counting pairs. Finally, this question asks candidates to pay close attention to constraints, testing a key skill for real-world development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After copying and pasting the prompt into ChatGPT, it spit out a response that attempted to brute force the problem. Depending on how CodeSignal 
presents the problem to a candidate, this could easily be worked around by modifying the prompt to indicate you are looking for a problem with a 
hash table. If that type of response isn't provided by CodeSignal though, ChatGPT would not have presented the expected solution, though it did 
still return expected results. The time trade off would have been seen with different test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I modified the prompt slightly to indicate that I wanted a response with a hash table. ChatGPT complied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;been&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seen&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passes the test cases as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the four sample questions provided by CodeSignal, the "basic" two questions are solved without any difficulty. A third takes a little prompt 
tweaking to indicate that we want a hashtable instead of a simple brute forced solution. The last one is difficult to evaluate without test cases. 
So, of the 3 that can be evaluated all pass easily. Two with very little modification (converting exponents). The third needs a small nudge toward 
the type of solution desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-this-mean"&gt;What's this mean?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-this-mean" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've looked at common interview questions from LeetCode, TestGorilla and now CodeSignal. As a hiring manager, I can see that a simple technical 
assessment of skills isn't enough to evaluate a candidate. Fortunately, I knew that already, but I'm hoping that others in the industry are seeing that
tools exist for developers to make their day to day lives easier. Those tools can, literally, do the work for them if you are presenting them with 
basic puzzles during the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already hear people saying that they do face to face coding, so this would never work in their process. You may be right, but ask yourselves this:
do you developers do face to face coding in their day to day work? If not, why are you evaluating your candidates with that type of pressure? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust your interview process to reflect what you actually need your candidates to demonstrate. A puzzle isn't real work. Give them a real problem
to talk through with your team. Evaluate their ability to solve a real problem so that you can learn about their thought processes, how they approach
a problem, and what resources they utilize.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="job search"/><category term="chatgpt"/><category term="ai interviews"/></entry><entry><title>Breaking TestGorilla interview questions with ChatGPT</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/breaking-the-interview-with-chatgpt.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-12-26T10:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-26T10:45:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-12-26:/breaking-the-interview-with-chatgpt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Using ChatGPT, I'm going to solve a couple interview questions from TestGorilla quickly, easily and with nothing more than copying and pasting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written quiet a bit about &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; in the last month. As of this post, it is still &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;banned on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. I believe I showed
why with my previous post. In it, I showed that &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html"&gt;ChatGPT is prone to adding subtle errors&lt;/a&gt; (and in some cases not so subtle), which is bad on
Q&amp;amp;A site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's post follows in the footsteps of my writing about how I hope ChatGPT inpires software engineering hiring managers to change their 
hiring process. I wrote about how &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;ChatGPT can solve LeetCode&lt;/a&gt; problems. Today's post is going to focus on a company called &lt;a href="https://www.testgorilla.com/"&gt;TestGorilla&lt;/a&gt; and a 
couple of their assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First a disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I was Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven Teams&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Prior to that, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html"&gt;I was a customer of Woven for over two years&lt;/a&gt;. 
Woven is a competitor of TestGorilla. That said, I do not recall TestGorilla being discussed during my employment at Woven. 
I only became aware of them during my job search this year. I'd be happy to do this same type of analysis on a Woven assessment, but as far 
as I am aware, their prompts are not presented publicly. TestGorilla's prompts used in this article are taken directly from their website. I did not 
speak with either company prior to writing this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="assessment-one-php-arrays"&gt;Assessment One - PHP Arrays&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#assessment-one-php-arrays" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first assessment I want to look at is related to PHP Arrays. The &lt;a href="https://app.testgorilla.com/preview/105976?language=en"&gt;prompt&lt;/a&gt; itself if fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TestGorilla - PHP Array Sample Prompt" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/testgorilla-php-array.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is billed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP (coding): intermediate-level algorithms
This PHP test evaluates candidates' coding skills through a short coding assignment. The test requires candidates to write code that meets certain requirements, and candidates can run their code to test if the result matches their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated time for this test is 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let's see if ChatGPT is an intermediate level PHP programmer. Pasting the prompt into ChatGPT quickly spits out a result, in Python. I'm not
surprised since almost all of my testing has been in Python. I provided one additional set of directions for ChatGPT to utilize, based on the boilerplate
code provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write this in PHP using the following as a template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sum_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Insert your code here &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result provided looks functional, based on very outdated PHP syntax knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sum_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$no2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copy and pasted that into TestGorilla's preview page and ran it to see how it'd do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;Task executed successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;Result: (190)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success! One intermediate PHP assessment completed. Total time taken: 2 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="assessment-two-kotlin-arrays"&gt;Assessment Two - Kotlin Arrays&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#assessment-two-kotlin-arrays" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://app.testgorilla.com/preview/788899?language=en"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; is listed as a "New Test" by TestGorilla at the time of this post. The challenge here, if ChatGPT fails, is that I have never
used Kotlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TestGorilla - Kotlin Array Sample Prompt" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/testgorilla-kotlin-array.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is billed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotlin (Coding): Working with Arrays
This Kotlin Coding test evaluates candidatesâ ability to work with arrays. The test gives candidates 30 minutes to create a short algorithm involving arrays while taking into consideration all the requirements provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is billed as a 20 minute assessment. It is also billed as an intermediate level assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and also provided the boiler plate code block. The prompt doesn't explicitly say "Kotlin" anywhere, and I didn't mention
it either. The only hint provided was the boiler plate code. ChatGPT picked up the language and returned a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;getUniqueStudentIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;{

}
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;distinct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;toTypedArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not knowing Kotlin, I can look at the code provided and see that improvements can be made to the code. The prompt says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all student IDs are 5-digit numbers beginning with the number 5. Return -1 as a single element in the array in the case of any invalid input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;if (a.any { it &amp;lt; 50000 || it &amp;gt; 99999 })&lt;/code&gt; statement can be adjusted to reflect the prompt's specification better. Additionally, there isn't a 
built in test case for invalid data, but I suspect that it'll fail based on the expected return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how TestGorilla is evaluating these edge cases on the paid version of this exam, this may be picked up. On the free preview version, though
it is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiring-process"&gt;Hiring process&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#hiring-process" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the reader should be able to see that a simple technical evaluation of software engineers in the hiring process is no longer sufficient. It 
took me longer to determine which prompts I wanted to evaluate for this post than it did to solve with a couple copy and pastes into ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hiring process must be more than "solve this code challenge". Hiring managers need to move past code only assessments. Instead, focus on a 
candidate's ability to technically assess and judge based on a context specific problem. These types of problems require a candidate to show their
experience, versus their ability to Google, ask Stack Overflow or use ChatGPT to provide a problem prompt. Evaluate your candidates based on the 
work you want them to actually do. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="job search"/><category term="chatgpt"/><category term="ai interviews"/></entry><entry><title>Using ChatGPT to interact with an API</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-12-20T23:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-20T23:45:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-12-20:/chatgpt-interact-with-external-api.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to take ChatGPT for a spin against an API that I know. Let's see what it's capable of producing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've played with &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; a lot since it was released publicly a few weeks ago. It's gotten a fair bit of media coverage (and I helped generate
some of that with the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;Stack Overflow ban of ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;). In my last post, I talked about how 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html"&gt;I hope that ChatGPT kills the LeetCode interview&lt;/a&gt; for Software Engineers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to test it out against an API that I know well. In April 2022, I left PacketFabric where I was Vice President of 
Software Engineering. I played with the PacketFabric API &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; during my tenure. I'm going to use that experience to see what ChatGPT 
can whip up in a few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-goal"&gt;The Goal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-goal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here is to ask ChatGPT for a quick script to interact with a portion of the API, test that output and see how I can extend it. My 
thought is that this is how an engineer is going to go about their work. They have a task they need to accomplish (call this API end point),
they need to make sure it works (test it), and then work on refining it to do what's needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal that I have is to write as little code as possible during this test. I'd love to copy and paste all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this test, I'll be using the &lt;a href="https://docs.packetfabric.com/api/v2/redoc/#tag/Locations/operation/get_location_list"&gt;Get Locations List&lt;/a&gt; end point. It's unauthenticated so I don't need to sign up for a demo account to get an 
API key. &lt;em&gt;Side Note: The documentation is wrong in that it states this end point requires a Bearer Token. This will be seen in the generated code and I don't fault ChatGPT for adding it into the code, because the documentation says it is required&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use PacketFabric's API (https://docs.packetfabric.com/api/v2/redoc/#tag/Locations/operation/get_location_list) to get a list of locations in California (&lt;code&gt;CA&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that I was provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"YOUR_API_KEY"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Authorization"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bearer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-Type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"application/json"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/location?state=CA"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Request failed with status code &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the Bearer token isn't required for this end point. It's inclusion does not impact the functionality of this 
script, and assuming I'm making more than calls to the &lt;code&gt;locations&lt;/code&gt; end point, it'll be needed anyway. I'll keep it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is a mistake in the code. For exactly the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;same reason we banned ChatGPT on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, we see a subtle error here too. If
you run the snippet above, you will get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Request failed with status code 404&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because ChatGPT is hitting the &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code&gt;locations&lt;/code&gt; (plural). The PacketFabric API uses plurals. This is a minor problem, and easily fixed,
though it is explicitly stated in the documentation link which end points exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finding-all-us-locations"&gt;Finding All US Locations&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#finding-all-us-locations" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I wanted to get all US locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I use this to get all US locations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct way to do this would be to use the &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; query parameter. ChatGPT had a different answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a list of all locations in the United States using PacketFabric's API, you can simply omit the state query parameter from the GET request. This will return a list of all locations across all states in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same code provided simply strips the &lt;code&gt;state=CA&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;requests.get()&lt;/code&gt; call. &lt;em&gt;This answer is wrong&lt;/em&gt;. It will, technically, return all 
public locations in the United States. But it will also return locations outside of the United States too. This is a much larger result set than I was 
looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer should be able to catch this during testing and realize that the code is incorrect. However, ChatGPT has a tendancy to write responses in a 
very confident manner. This one is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finding-a-specific-pop-location"&gt;Finding a specific POP location&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#finding-a-specific-pop-location" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to the next test, I wanted to find locations just in a single point of presence (POP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I get all locations in the &lt;code&gt;ATL1&lt;/code&gt; pop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response returned seemed reasonable. There was a bit of prose with this explaination and a code snippet that adjusted the query parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a list of all locations in the ATL1 pop (point of presence) using PacketFabric's API, you will need to send a GET request to the /location endpoint with the &lt;code&gt;pop_code&lt;/code&gt; query parameter set to ATL1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;"https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/locations?pop_code=ATL1"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is incorrect. &lt;code&gt;pop_code&lt;/code&gt; isn't a valid query parameter. It's not in the documentation and it doesn't return the expected result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to explain this to the bot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pop_code&lt;/code&gt; isn't a parameter defined in the documentation. Is this an undocumented parameter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received an unexpected response, with a new code snippet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. &lt;code&gt;pop_code&lt;/code&gt; is not a valid query parameter for the /location endpoint in PacketFabric's API.
The documentation for the /location endpoint (https://docs.packetfabric.com/api/v2/redoc/#tag/Locations/operation/get_location_list) lists the valid query parameters as state, city, and zip_code. These parameters can be used to filter the locations returned by the API based on the state, city, and ZIP code of the location.
For example, to get a list of all locations in Atlanta, Georgia (GA), you could use the following request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"YOUR_API_KEY"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Authorization"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bearer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-Type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"application/json"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/location?state=GA&amp;amp;city=Atlanta"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Request failed with status code &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will send a GET request to the /location endpoint with the state query parameter set to GA and the city query parameter set to Atlanta, and will print the list of locations returned by the API.
I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a better attempt - but still wrong. Going this route will return more POPs than expected. I'll receive everything in the city of Atlanta, instead
of my original request, which was to only get locations in the &lt;code&gt;ATL1&lt;/code&gt; POP. This is another subtly wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to note that ChatGPT says that only &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ZIP code&lt;/code&gt; are valid query parameters here. &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt; are defined 
in the documentation. &lt;code&gt;ZIP Code&lt;/code&gt; is not. That's not a valid query parameter for the locations end point. Also notice that it's still using the singular
&lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression of ChatGPT has not changed much since it was released at the end of November. It is a novel tool - much like Github's copilot, but 
it's not going to take a developer's job. It can provide a good starting point for a problem, but if you are depending on it to write your code for you,
you will find it's not going to work long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this test, I learned that I don't know what it is doing about reading external documentation. I simply provided a link to the API documentation,
when asking how to get locations. It parsed out the correct URL schema, including version code. But, at the same time, it couldn't parse out the 
query parameters. It incorrectly added two parameters that don't exist (&lt;code&gt;pop_code&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;zip_code&lt;/code&gt;). It also missed the plurality of the API end points.
It introduced a subtle bug - omitting the &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; to get US based locations, returns locations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'd be upset if an engineer on my team committed code generated in this test. It's buggy, and has subtle inaccuracies. The code
provided by ChatGPT is a good &lt;em&gt;skeleton&lt;/em&gt;. It is up to the developer to validate that it works as expected. Without the crucial step of developer testing,
it is guarenteed that bugs will be committed to the code base because "the AI said it'd work".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use ChatGPT (or Copilot or a system similar to either), it is vital that you verify the code you are running. Does it do what you 
expect? Does it perform as you expect? The tools are there to help you build this, but that's just it. &lt;em&gt;Help&lt;/em&gt;, not do. The testing I did here took
only a handful of minutes. For someone unfamiliar with the API they are interacting with, this quick turn around should mean they have a lot more time
to do robust testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="chatgpt"/></entry><entry><title>ChatGPT is here - Use that to stop asking LeetCode questions during interviews</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-12-15T23:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-15T23:45:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-12-15:/chatgpt-should-end-leetcode-interviews.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT's availability and ability to answer basic questions should end LeetCode use in software engineering interviews.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have interviewed a lot of software engineers looking for a new position. I've talked with college students looking for
an internship, junior engineers just getting started, staff engineers looking for a new role, managers and directors to
lead these teams. In every one of those interviews, I'd told the candidate that I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; puzzle questions (ie.
"How many windows are in Seattle?") and I hate LeetCode style questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; is good at solving these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good. Maybe that will kill LeetCode interview questions once and for all. There are so many better ways to determine if an
engineer is the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chatgpt-vs-leetcode"&gt;ChatGPT vs LeetCode&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#chatgpt-vs-leetcode" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html"&gt;temporarily banned ChatGPT over on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, because it can and does provide subtly incorrect answers.
It's been so bad that we called up two new moderators from the previous election today. One of my mod &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421619/2022-community-moderator-election-results-now-with-two-more-mods#comment939591_421619"&gt;colleagues provided some
context&lt;/a&gt; around this today too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a few hundred CGPT flags per day, leading to hundreds or even thousands of post deletions per day. There's often one flag per user (not accounting overlap from several users), but each flag can lead to anywhere between a couple and tens of deletions per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeetCode, however, checks your answer right away. They don't have the same problem as Stack Overflow. I wanted to see just how good 
this new chatbot was, and took it for a spin against a random LeetCode problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I randomly selected a medium difficulty problem with a 58% acceptance rate. My victim question:
&lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/"&gt;1143. Longest Common Subsequence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in passing this test, is selecting the entire prompt, copying it and pasting it directly into LeetCode's UI. I didn't read
the prompt and I didn't format it. Just a blind copy and paste. I also provided one instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide python code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subsequence&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It likes the phrase &lt;a href="https://guides.codepath.com/compsci/DP-Table"&gt;"dynamic programming table"&lt;/a&gt;. Along with this code, it even explains its reasoning for going this route. Maybe 
our intrepid AI can teach a junior dev a new trick or two while doing this puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ChatGPT explains its code" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/leetcode-response1-1.png"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="ChatGPT explains its algorithm" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/leetcode-response1-2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it shows that tests pass...very confidently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the tests passed, so this implementation is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-result"&gt;The result&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-result" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to show that ChatGPT can do this, so at this point I haven't read the prose above. I copy and pasted the code it returned
and clicked "Submit".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited a few seconds for all tests to run and got my results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ChatGPT beats over 96% of other implementations in runtime performance and 71% in memory performance" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/leetcode-implementation.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT crushed this. It performs better than 96% of other submissions in terms of run time performance. It uses less memory than 71% of
other submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="can-we-please-stop-using-leetcode-now"&gt;Can we please stop using LeetCode now?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#can-we-please-stop-using-leetcode-now" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total time it took to perform this test was under 5 minutes. I randomly selected a problem, copy and pasted the prompt, waited for a response
from the chatbot, copy and pasted the code response, waited for the tests to run. Complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a hiring manager, I'd have wasted my time and the candidates time having them do this problem now. Instead, we can talk about 
an actual problem they will be solving. We can do a real world problem instead this. There are better ways to interview an engineer
and I'm hoping ChatGPT makes that abundantly clear to hiring managers everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to have to adapt our hiring processes, but that's a good thing. My recent experience shows that at most companies, it's bad anyway.
Now we have an opportunity to shine some sunlight on it and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you continue to use LeetCode or something similar to evaluate your candidate's technical skills, your are doing your 
team a huge diservice. Candidates know about this tool, and they know that the easiest way to get an interview is to play the game. There 
have been tens of thousands of layoffs in the tech industry in the last six months. I guarentee candidates are looking for every advantage they can
get, to move to their next role.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="job"/><category term="leadership"/><category term="job search"/><category term="chatgpt"/><category term="ai interviews"/></entry><entry><title>Rise Garden Two Year Follow Up</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-two-year-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-12-07T08:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-07T08:45:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-12-07:/rise-garden-two-year-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After two and half years of using the Rise Garden product, how is it holding up? This article provides an update.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I last talked about the [Rise Garden][risegarden] my family is using, it was during my first harvest two and a half years ago.
I said &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-final-review.html"&gt;I'd get the garden again&lt;/a&gt;. During the posts at the time, I also covered some
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-physical.html"&gt;physical changes that would be helpful&lt;/a&gt; and
some &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html"&gt;application suggestions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been two and a half years since I first assembled the garden and two years since my last update at the end of the previous article. Let's
review and see how the garden has held up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above that I provided a few suggestions, and raised a few concerns. Here's a quick summary of those, so that we can easily see what
I'm looking to address here based on concerns then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of plants the garden supports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few fruiting plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of pods that don't sprout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription service item availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrient build up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="application"&gt;Application&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the application itself. In my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I raised a couple
concerns I had about the mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In good news, the splash screen issue has been resolved. The log in issue has also been resolved. I do still need to occassionally re-login, but
overall, the application remembers me a lot longer than the handful of days it did at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lighting options have also been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lighting options are updated to include sunrise/sunset options" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2022-garden-lights.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have more than a simple time and duration option. The sunrise and sunset options aren't exactly what I asked for two years ago, but
this is a nice compromise. It's winter, so I've moved my garden inside to a warmer location, which unfortunately places it out of direct
sunlight. However, during the rest of the year, this gradual lighting is nice, because I was able to time it to when the sun
hits the garden and when it does not. This allowed me to use less than 100% lighting through out the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a complaint about this new screen though. Look back at my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html"&gt;screen shot of the previous lighting page&lt;/a&gt;. Previously,
I could select any time for the lights to come on, and it was a pretty intuitive hour/minute selector. Now, it is a single slider with 15 minute
increments. It is really hard to hit exactly what you want with a slider. It takes a lot of small adjustments to get the time I want my
lights to come on with this slider. I think moving to a slider from the hour/minute selector was a bad user experience choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that wasn't the only bad user experience change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Garden plants screen" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2022-garden-plants.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new page showing my garden is awful. The previous version showed an overview of the entire garden, and then allowed me to click a plant to
get more details. This version shows a single tray on a single level and involves both vertical and horizontal scrolling to see all of my plants.
I do not like this change. There is a lot more tapping and dragging around the screen to find specific plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last application problem I'm still seeing is that plant information is wildly inaccurate. This is my current pea plant, that the application
says is past harvest. It hasn't even started flowering yet. In two years, this page has not been accurate for a single plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Flowers on this pea plant yet, despite the app saying it's past harvest time" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2022-garden-peaplant.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="plants"&gt;Plants&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#plants" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing images show very full gardens. When I've attempted full gardens and followed the application's recommendations, I get sub-optimal
harvests. The large plants crowd out one another, even with aggressive pruning. The vines will take over an entire level and smother others, without
aggressive pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants that I can get to grow most consistently are lettuces and herbs. Fortunately, we use a lot of both. But, it'd be nice to get a consistent
pepper, tomato, cucumber or pea plant each harvest too. Unfortunately, adding more than a couple of those plants to the entire garden results in a
plant that doesn't produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining this with the sprouting failure rate I mentioned 2 years ago, that hasn't improved, it becomes a gamble on what to grow sometimes. The
sprouting problems continue to plague each harvest, with approximately 1 out of 10 seeds across all plants not sprouting. Unfortunately, on my
latest batch, I had 3 lettuce and 1 pea plant that didn't sprout. This was my highest failure rate so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did notice, while writing this post, that Rise Gardens &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/products/indoor-garden-nursery"&gt;released a new nursery&lt;/a&gt;. It only supports 4 pods though, compared to the 12 pods one of
my current nurseries holds. I'd have to replan how and when I plant certain plants (or buy extra of these small nurseries). I like to get two
sets of lettuce in for 1 tomatato plant due to their different growth cycles. Fewer nursery spots would enforce more staggered growing. This isn't bad
just something I'd need to adapt to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="seed-subscriptions"&gt;Seed Subscriptions&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#seed-subscriptions" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complained two years ago about the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html"&gt;lack of variety packs&lt;/a&gt;. The garden came with a
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;salad mix and a variety pack of plants&lt;/a&gt;. Those aren't offered as part of the subscription service. I don't need 4 tomato pods, because
I can't get them all to grow at once, like I mentioned above. But, if I could get a tomato, a pepper and a couple other plants, I have a nice set
of plants that I could use all at once. That is assuming that they all sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep looking for this. Until then, I turn my subscription on and off for about three months at a time, because otherwise I just get to many
seeds to utilize and I don't need to buy a subscription for seeds that have an increasingly common failure rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="garden-hardware"&gt;Garden Hardware&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#garden-hardware" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden hardware has held up really well. I did replace the original DC30 pump with the upgraded DC40 pump about six months ago. I did this
because I kept getting nutrient build up in my tubing and along the bottom of my trays. Theorectically, the more powerful pump should solve
this problem. At the end of my current harvest I'll have a better idea of how well it's worked, but I haven't had to do an emergency tube
cleaning because the water couldn't get past the build up, so that is a positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also installed chicken wire around the garden to give my climbing plants something to climb. This has been great at keeping the vine plants -
peas and cucumbers - under control. It also has allowed a couple spots on the level they sit on to remain open because they don't completely
overwhelm a tray. I have been able to utilize that to grow a faster plant on the level of these vine plants before they have spread all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one physical concern I mentioned two years ago was the inability to easily level the garden. This still remains a problem because the garden
needs to be level to ensure the water flows correctly. When I have the garden in my sunroom - which is less level than other areas of my house, I
have a small wooden splint built to keep the garden leveled correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still highly recommend that Rise Garden make adjustable footings in their next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-review"&gt;Summary Review&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary-review" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now: Would I get it again. Previously, I said that I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-final-review.html"&gt;absolutely would&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would still do this again, but I think I'd get a smaller garden - something like the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4e8xTIv"&gt;one level garden&lt;/a&gt; of mine, or maybe the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3AU9bNF"&gt;personal sized garden&lt;/a&gt; for a handful of lettuce heads. This isn't because I don't want to grow plants indoors and year round. It's
because I can't utilize all of the space I have now. A completely full garden hasn't been productive for me. I leave space open every time I plants.
It's also due to the number of seeds that I've had not sprout. If I have less space to plant, I'll be a little more choosey on what I plants
versus "I have some space available and might as well use it if these sprout". Additionally, the application changes have been very off
putting. The new tray page is unusable and the inaccurate plant pages continue to be unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This said, I am still enjoying growing my own food. It's still not sustainable, but that was never my goal. It's a fun activity. The kids enjoy
planting and harvesting. They glance at it once and a while and provide updates on how they think things are growing or what we can harvest
for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Garden Stats - 107 pounds of produce, 2800 gallons of water saved, 190,000 food miles saved" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2022-garden-stats.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stats fall into the same category as the plant stats. I'm not sure how reliable they actually are, but it is nice to see
numbers. Saving nearly 3,000 gallons of water over two and a half years is drop in the bucket, but it's still good to see an impact.
Rise Gardens describes it's &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/blogs/communitygarden/earth-day-transforming-the-food-system-one-garden-at-a-time"&gt;"Food Miles" equation&lt;/a&gt; on their blog. Going with my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/time-gas-saved-with-remote-work.html"&gt;calculations from this summer on gasoline savings&lt;/a&gt; and CO2 not
produced due to remote work, I've made another tiny positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Rise Gardens: Add strawberries as a plant you provide in your subscriptions. I'd still like that API I talked about before, but I'd be much happier with strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and do something about the seeds not sprouting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Stack Overflow bans ChatGPT temporarily</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-12-05T14:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-12-05:/stackoverflow-bans-chatgpt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today Stack Overflow moderators banned ChatGPT on the site. This is my reflection on why we went this route.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today Stack Overflow moderators (&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/collecting-diamonds-on-stack-exchange.html"&gt;myself included&lt;/a&gt;), have implemented a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/421831/189134"&gt;temporary ban on ChatGPT on the site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of ChatGPT generated text for posts on Stack Overflow is temporarily banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ban was picked up immediately by several &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stack+overflow+chatgpt&amp;amp;biw=1506&amp;amp;bih=1308&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A12%2F5%2F2022%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F5%2F2022"&gt;technology news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/stack-overflow-temporarily-bans-answers-from-openais-chatgpt-chatbot/"&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23493932/chatgpt-ai-generated-answers-temporarily-banned-stack-overflow-llms-dangers"&gt;TheVerge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnaem/stack-overflow-bans-chatgpt-for-constantly-giving-wrong-answers"&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt;. 
It was also picked up by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/tech/chatgpt-trnd/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/chatgpt-could-makedemocracy-even-more-messy/2022/12/06/e613edf8-756a-11ed-a199-927b334b939f_story.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that I want to answer is "Why?". Stories and marketing from &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, give reasons why this new chatbot is a 
"good thing". With their examples, it definately looks that way. But, in practice, it's not working out so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses that users have been posting on Stack Overflow have a high rate of being incorrect. Normally, the community can handle this, but the responses aren't your usual small code snippet of an answer. Instead it is a long, detailed, 
explaination that &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; plausible. But, it's wrong. Combined with users posting multiple answers an hour, this is
a lot of content that Stack Overflow reviewers (or worse, the handful of elected moderators) to go through and determine if it's valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time the ban was implemented, we'd seen thousands of answers generated by ChatGPT. On the one hand, this is impressive 
work on the ChatGPT AI itself. It can be difficult to detect and is good at holding a conversation. On the other hand, 
and more important from Stack Overflow's perspective, this isn't helping the user base. Thousands of subtly wrong answers is awful. 
It doesn't help the user looking for help, and it will very quickly destroy the trust that millions of developers put in the site if
this is allowed to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit that I'm disappointed that AI hasn't reached the point where it can do what ChatGPT &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to do. But, this is a step
forward. Unfortunately, this step seems to have left a bad taste in the mouth of developers looking for help beyond 
a toy example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, ChatGPT is banned on Stack Overflow. The &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=moderators"&gt;moderation team&lt;/a&gt; will continue to work with the company to 
ensure the community we have volunteered to moderatate remains one of high quality. Additionally, as the larger &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/384396/186281"&gt;Stack Exchange 
network of sites debates a similar ban&lt;/a&gt;, the Stack Overflow moderation team will be able to provide input on our experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/><category term="chatgpt"/></entry><entry><title>Updating the design of the site</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/relaunch-personal-site.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-11-17T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-11-17T10:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-11-17:/relaunch-personal-site.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've updated this site with a new theme and some under the hood improvements. This article covers those updates and what I hope to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-the-update"&gt;Welcome to the update!&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-the-update" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a new theme for the site, and I think it looks great! This is a heavily modified 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex"&gt;Flex&lt;/a&gt; theme. I talk about the changes I made to the theme below, as well as my goals 
for the site going forward. A new theme isn't going be responsible for hitting all of those goals, but I think it will help. The
site was pretty bland before. It did what it needed to do, but it didn't look the best doing it. My skillset is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; front end
development, but I am rather proud of the new theme and the changes I put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're curious about what the site used to look like, jump down to the &lt;a href="#where-the-site-was"&gt;Where the site was&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default version of the Flex theme can be seen on it's &lt;a href="https://flex.alxd.me/"&gt;demo site&lt;/a&gt;, to give you an idea of the changes I've
made to my instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="look-feel"&gt;Look &amp;amp; Feel&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#look-feel" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo is perhaps the most subtle change. It's designed, intentionally, to not be a circle (to common on other sites )or a square (to boring).
It's an off shape blob. Take a look at it. It very slowly shifts too. You can see it along the bottom of the shirt most clearly. It's designed
to move only a little and pretty slowly, so that it's not distracting. It's just active enough to catch your eye if you are looking but not 
designed to pull focus from the article you are reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default flex theme is very...neat. There are nice crisp lines. It's very clinical. I changed this just a little with splash of a curved
red border between the side bar and the main article. It's not a major change, but it adds a little personality. Combined with the 
blob/animated head shot, it makes it feel unique among the flex theme'd blogs I looked at to evaluate if I liked the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favicon is such a little thing, but I didn't have one with the old theme. Having one now adds just a little bit more of a 
professional touch and it was so easy to do. The color of the favicon, the side bar, and the responsive bars from the tag and 
category pages all match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="toc"&gt;ToC&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#toc" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table on contents on the side bar is an addition I made, because I dislike when the table of contents scrolls off the screen. It's the same 
reason I froze the table of contents to the side bar on the previous iteration of the site. When I'm reading, I like to know how far I am in 
and article and be able to easily jump to another section. Since I am also a reader of my site (especially on the technical posts), I try
to make it easy for myself too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tagscategories"&gt;Tags/Categories&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#tagscategories" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tags and category pages on my old site where bad. They were a giant list of meta-data and a link to a post. It was messy. I didn't like
it, but I also didn't use it so I spent very little time trying to make it work better. With a new theme, I wanted to make the pages more 
useful, at least to me. I found an excellent post by &lt;a href="https://johnpaton.net/posts/responsive-bar-chart/"&gt;John Paton&lt;/a&gt; on how to make a responsive bar chart for these pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take look at my &lt;a href="/tags.html"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/categories.html"&gt;categories&lt;/a&gt; pages. To me, that looks wonderful. I can get a quick look at how many articles 
are in each section and clicking on one brings me to a page specifically for articles in that slice of meta-data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="seo"&gt;SEO&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#seo" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you run away...this is a good thing, and I've been doing it for a while. All of my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/tag/review.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;, have been sporting Schema.org
Review microdata for years. My blog posts have been sporting Article microdata. This was all hard coded into my template. It was beyond time to
update to utilize JSON+LD and provide even more context to the topics I write about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I selected Flex because it claims to support Rich Snippets. My results on that are fuzzy, at best. The snippets provided are not full
rich snippets. However, they provided a great base. I've updated my instance to support JSON+LD for Person (click view source on my 
&lt;a href="about/"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt; to see it), Article, Review and Breadcrumbs (see the navigation bar at the top of this page). Search engines use all 
of that to get a better idea of what's on the site. I have a few more I want to implement too, but this gets me beyond parity with my old theme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also made sure that canonical links are included in my articles. I have a couple that Google sees as duplicates due to UTM tags I stuck on
links a while ago. Having cononical links in place should resolve some annoying errors and warnings I see in my search console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="goals-of-the-update"&gt;Goals of the update&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#goals-of-the-update" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few goals with this newly updated site. A couple relate directly to the theme, and a few are general site goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated Tool set - I was running an old version of Pelican and missed out on some new features. By updating, I'm hoping that I 
can remain closer to the current release. I like to get the newest features, and that alone feels better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A useful tags and categories page. Like I mentioned above, they used to be useless. Now, there is more than just a list of 1-2 
work phrases sitting on my site across two pages. If I start another series - I believe I have two right now total, I may add a 
similar series page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site face lift. As you can see below, the old version was pretty bland. This update adds some color, makes a few things more accessible,
and generally feels less like reading a sheet of paper on a screen. It's not the flashiest thing on the internet, but you can see 
by my social media links to the left, that I'm not that type of person anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better SEO. Obviously a template doesn't immediately solve this problem, but it will help. Plus some other plans to add more content (gasp!)
and it should help. Right now, though, "Andrew Wegner" returns this page 9th on Google. It's behind someone with a different last name spelling,
someone with a different first name, and a few other "Andrew Wegners". While search for a job, I couldn't depend on my site being the one that 
was clicked. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, a vanity goal, is to get a Knowledge Graph when searching for my name. It'll take a while before I can get there, but some of the 
SEO work I'm putting in now will, hopefully, pay off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-the-site-was"&gt;Where the site was&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-the-site-was" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last trip down memory lane, as the template that has served as the base of the site since the intial &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html"&gt;migration from Wordpress in 2015&lt;/a&gt; is retired. The old template was using &lt;a href="https://elegant.oncrashreboot.com/"&gt;Elegant&lt;/a&gt;. I am the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/graphs/contributors"&gt;#7 contributor to the theme&lt;/a&gt; at the time of publishing 
this. That's not saying a whole lot, with my brief spurt of activity in 2019, but it was a contribution that I hope others using the theme 
are able to utilize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stuck on the Pelican 3.0 branch. I really don't remember why. I remember attempting to upgrade to Pelican 4.0 and everything broke. At the 
time I was unable to spend a significant time to fix it, so I rolled back and stuck with the latest version that ran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through this revamp, I upgraded to the latest Pelican, the newest Markdown and go all the new fancy things. We'll see if they actually 
improve my experience. From a user stand point, not much should change other than a visual overhual. It's a static site and is designed to be
pretty non-interactive. On my side though, I'm hoping things are a little less brittle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the last pictures of the old template. &lt;/p&gt;

But, it's done so poorly that candidates have awful experiences. What does a current job search look like?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for a new role, especially when you don't have one at the time, is stressful. In my industry, it's common for a 
candidate to attend multiple interview rounds and participate in a technical evaluation. Depending on the company and role, you may have to defend your technical work as well. This is stressful and takes &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 4 hours of time, not counting the technical evaluation. That can range anywhere from an hour to a full week of time, again depending on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is for a single role. When a candidate is applying to multiple roles, it literally becomes a full time job to find a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-rejection"&gt;The rejection&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-rejection" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejection during a job search is part of the process. Companies only have so many openings to fill. As a candidate, you put hours of time into your goal of getting a role and then, unfortunately, the dreaded rejection shows up. It happenes, but it'd be nice if it was useful so that you can move on to the next role and make improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-reality-of-rejection"&gt;The reality of rejection&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-reality-of-rejection" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, recent experience has shown me that very few companies want to provide useful feedback. There are a few key things that tell me immediately that the rejection isn't going to be useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no-reply&lt;/strong&gt; - This means that the company hasn't set up thier applicant tracking system to use a real person's name for the email template you are about to read. Why? Because they don't want to answer your questions. Thus, it's not an offer to continue with the process. This is a "here's the door" email. This one especially hurts after you've talked with a portion of the interview team already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Promotions&lt;/strong&gt; - During my search this summer, I received a surprising number of rejections that told me I was rejected due to an internal promotion. Every single one of these came as a surprise, because the interviewer never mentioned this as a potiential outcome. This one hurts because you've spent the time and effort to get through multiple rounds of interviews to find out you have been rejected due to someone having the inside track. Congratulations to those individuals receiving a promotion, but letting your external candidates know this is a possibility would go a long way to improving candidate experience. In fact, the companies that &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; mention this was a possibility, were the ones that provided meaningful feedback when a rejection was received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We are fortunate to receive many qualified candidates..."&lt;/strong&gt; - This phrase or the countless variations tell me I'm about to read a templated rejection with no substance. I don't think any company is going say that their candidates are horrible, or that they receive only one or two candidates. I read this as a "participation award" sentence, but it doesn't tell me &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I've been rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghosting&lt;/strong&gt; - This isn't to be confused with never hearing from a company in the first place. That happens plenty too, but it's less annoying if you've never talked to anyone at the company. Technically, you never get an email with this reason, because ghosting is when you've taken the time to talk with someone at the company or participated in the technical evaluation, and then hear nothing back. The further into the interview process you get, when ghosting occurs, the more annoying it is. During my hunt, I had three companies ghost me after the fourth interview. I had two companies ghost me after sitting down and talking with the CEO of the company. Despite follow ups on my part, it is simply radio silence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-good-rejection"&gt;The good rejection&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-good-rejection" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this world of horrible candidate experience, there are a few shining stars. One of the biggest ways to improve candidate experience, is to provide meaningful feedback on why they were rejected. A candidate is a professional and should be able to accept that feedback and use it to improve themselves for other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key things, in my opinion, about these companies is that despite receiving a rejection I still would love to work for the company in the future. They are on my short list of companies to watch out for when looking for a role either for myself or as a referral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this type of rejection look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rejection comes in the form of an email you can respond to or a person you can speak with directly. The communication isn't copied for a template, but a real attempt to communicate the reasons you weren't the right person for the role. These reasons aren't a vague reference to skills or feelings, but are a real attempt to point out an area where you are missing a skill that the company needs for the person in this role to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a candidate puts in the time and effort to speak with your team multiple times, I believe the company should be able to compose an email offering a brief reasoning why they were not hired. This is especially true the further a candidate gets into the hiring process and the companies that understand this, will have a list of high quality candidates waiting in the wings next time they have roles to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my third adventure into learning little bit about &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5"&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt;, I set out to learn a little
bit more about modeling water. This was kind of brushed over in the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-realistic-environment-design-beginner.html"&gt;first course&lt;/a&gt; I took, and not touched
at all in the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-complete-beginners-course.html"&gt;second course&lt;/a&gt;. I was hoping to learn about real time water simulation based on a couple of the
course content section headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: That's not in this course. However, I was not disappointed in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-beginners-guide-building-environment/"&gt;Unreal Engine 5 Beginners Guide to Building an Environment&lt;/a&gt; by 3D Tudor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udemy says this is an 18.5 hour course. Plan on more than that. The instructor does a great job at explaining what the goal of the
section is, how it will be accomplished, and then showing how it's done. The end goal of the course is building a little cabin in
the mountains along a lake. You go from nothing, to basic blocking out the cabin, to setting up the landscape. From there you build the cabin, set up foliage, adding textures and details, to setting up the water material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that I was hoping for a real time water simulation. You don't get that here, but you do spend some time building
and setting up a water material that can be customized extensively. There are lessons on setting up a waterfall, building and animating birds
in the background, and adding fireflies. Time is spent building a fire pit and simulating the fire and smoke. Finally it ends with
setting up a camera and rendering the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this course covers a LOT and the instructor takes the time to explain what is happening and setting up the course very logically.
The time spent going through the entire workflow is helpful to see how to go from an empty grey box, to a very nice looking cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan on spending more than the allocated time in several lessons. Multiple times in the course, I found myself just playing with how
the scene looked. This became my painting canvas. The end goal was a cabin by the lake, but it wasn't to be identical to the
instructors (and mine is not). I found knowledge provided was wonderful to spark new ideas in how I could make the scene my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="future-learning-goal"&gt;Future learning Goal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#future-learning-goal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that I need to learn more about rendering a scene in the future. My initial output was grainy. It looked compressed and I was
a little saddened to see that environment that I spent so much time in look so...2005 in how it was output. I did manage to make it a little
better. This is a three camera clip of my result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l4i1V2OMnUs"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 20 seconds is just a static shot from the side of the cabin. This shows off the fire pit, the background birds, fireflies
and waterfall as well as the nice lighting from the sky. The other 40 seconds are split to show a few different areas in a quick flyby.
I did this on my own because I wanted more than just a static shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="high-quality-renders"&gt;High quality renders&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#high-quality-renders" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I did find is that by default, Unreal Engine renders with compression. I tried turning that off to see the results. I quickly learned
that a 20 second clip will reach almost 4.5GB of storage space. I'm still new at this...but ouch. That's a lot of space for a longer cinematic.
I'm not sure how to get a super high quality without that much space though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also couldn't figure out how to render it as a 4K video, instead of 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first clip in high quality (1080p):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myBTHdU694c"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy with this one. Everything looks good. Even those birds. I learned during this course that I do NOT have the skill set of 3D sculpt.
However, that's ok. Those birds are in the background. The animation on the wings works perfectly and they look like they belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next clip is flying from the side, over the island that I put in the lake to break up the water. In this shot you get a better look at the
waterfalls in the distance, the chance to see all four sides of the house and some more details on the roof and dock. If you look closely
around the 12 second mark you can also see some floating rocks. This looks like some foliage that is "touching" the landscaping - in the very
back - and didn't stay attached the the side of the landscape going into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uvEKQTpy32o"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the last clip in high quality is a fly over the lake. It starts by getting a good look at the waterfall (and some more floating rocks). It then flies through the fireflies crossing the river, and gives another look at the cabin and firepit. Finally it pulls back along the river to give a wide shot of the entire scene. A few things to point out - around the 14 second mark, you can see the mountain in the background floating above the landscape. I should have caught that, but I was more focused on keeping the cabin in the shot that I let the camera go to high and you can see a bit of level design that wasn't meant to be shown. Around the 16 second mark, as the camera pulls back, you can see the water texture start to change. I'm not sure what is causing that, but my guess is because of the lighting angles. I don't know how to fix it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4x7yg7FSAUA"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked this course. I went into it hoping to learn some water simulation, and instead learned about a whole lot more. I also made a
pretty good water material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the course to be well paced, excellently explained, and almost like an art class at times. The instructor taught you the techniques
you should use to build the end result but didn't want you to copy. You made it your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the time to spare (one of the downsides to this course is the length), as a beginner, you'll learn a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on my journey to learn a little bit about &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5"&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt;, I turned to Udemy again for a
course I could take that would help to learn some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-complete-beginners-course/"&gt;Unreal Engine 5: The Complete Beginner's Course&lt;/a&gt; by David Nixon. I wanted to learn more than
landscaping (like I did in the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/ue5-realistic-environment-design-beginner.html"&gt;last course&lt;/a&gt;). This was a ten hour course and covered much more of Unreal
Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end goal of the course was to create a very basic game. This would demonstrate building a level, adding
materials, enemies, puzzles, victory conditions, and more. To me, this course was really two courses mashed into
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="course-one-overview"&gt;Course One - Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-one-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the course and the majority of the content, was the practical overview of how everything works in
Unreal Engine. The instructor went over individual sections - designing a level, setting up the player, collisions, audio and
most importantly, blue prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sections of the course were detailed and demonstrated how various settings would impact the overall project. Additionally,
the instructor injected just enough (bad) puns to keep the content from getting boring. This portion of the course I found very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="course-two-the-tutorials"&gt;Course Two - The Tutorials&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-two-the-tutorials" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other part of the course was the hands on tutorials. At the start of the course, this is what I was looking forward to the most. Unfortunately,
this is where I felt the course fell flat. The tutorials did their job and my video below demonstrates it was effective - I have a completed game
(and I was cool to the kids for the minute and half it took them to beat it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tutorials are rushed. On the better laid out ones, its obvious that the voice over was recorded after the video because the vocal instructions
get 2-3 steps ahead of what the video is showing. This makes following along difficult when these are literally just "click here, change this value"
rapid fire instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many of the instructions provided are to set exact object dimensions or locations, with no explaination of why or how these were found.
The end result is a project that works...but I am left wondering &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; certain dimensions were found. Was this done via guess and check? Did the
instructor do fancy math to figure out where to place walls? Is there a systematic way that these could have been placed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to those questions. Instead, to follow along with the rushed tutorials, I typed in the same numbers as the instructor
and have literally the same project as they do because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was better than the previous one, but I still feel like it could have been so much better. The overview portions of the course were
really good. Unfortunately, they didn't translate as well into the tutorial lectures. While the tutorials accomplished the goal of building a
simple game, they left out so much content that would be useful to know. The tutorials moved quickly and felt more like checking off boxes to
make a game instead of designing, debugging, or even just providing a little explaination on how or why certain decisions were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this course for the overviews provided. If you know going into it that the tutorials will get you the game I have below, without a lot
of the design decisions behind it, then all the better. However, don't take this just for the tutorials. They are quick and lack context on why
certain things are being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an idea for a game in my head. I've had it for a while, but I don't know anything about video game design. 
&lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5"&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt; came out in April 2022. The demo looked amazing. The thought of my game continues to 
pop in and out of my brain over time. With my current &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/looking-for-new-role.html"&gt;free time&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to learn a little bit about 
how Unreal Engine works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-outdoor-level-design/"&gt;Unreal Engine 5 - Realistic Environment Design for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;, by Gavin Eisenbeisz on Udemy. My goal
was to get a very basic understanding of how the tool worked and decide if I'd continue forward. I knew going into this
that a 5 hour course wasn't going to be enough to learn everything of Unreal Engine, but hopefully it'd be enough to 
determine if I should learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am conflicted in how to properly evaluate this course. I have several complaints about the course (below), but 
it did meet my goal of getting me a basic understanding of how an aspect of the tool worked and I do want to continue 
learning how to use Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, my concerns...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="version"&gt;Version&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#version" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was last updated in June of 2021. I mentioned about that Unreal Engine 5 came out in April 2022. The instructor is 
using an early access edition of Unreal Engine 5. This means the UI is slightly different, a few bugs exist - namely landscape material
blend is black on the non-early access version of Unreal Engine 5, and a few options have been merged or moved in the full release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version difference isn't a deal breaker, but it does mean that quick clicks the instructor does on video don't align to the UI currently
in use on version 5.0.3. They are in different locations or are renamed or simply merged into another option that isn't clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="instructor-response"&gt;Instructor response&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#instructor-response" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor has not been responsive to students in the course. The landscape material bug has multiple discussion threads on the 
course Q&amp;amp;A section, but no response from the instructor. Students are clearly frustrated at the lack of response, and some have given up the 
course because they assume this bug prevents them from moving forward. Buried in the comments is a note from another student that this does 
not impact other areas AND the material will be useable when painting the landscape. Again, frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of good in the course though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="landscape-tooling"&gt;Landscape tooling&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#landscape-tooling" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a title of "Realistic Environment Design", it's not surprising that the course focused on building a landscape. Covering sculpting, 
texturing, decorating and a few small environment things like collisions and basic lighting, I was able to create an island. It's not going 
to win any awards for level design, but for a first time, I'm proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the kids now was to add "all the things" to my island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgive the lack of true cinematics, and only 6 seconds of video...this wasn't covered in the course and I probably found an old way to do this 
manually, but here is my island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EpP63rH-NZI"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not recommend Unreal Engine 5 - Realistic Environment Design for Beginners as your first introduction to Unreal Engine 5. The course is 
a year out of date and running on an early access version of the engine. However, if you know the tooling a little bit (or are willing to pause and
Google a quick how to), the overview of the landscaping tools were useful for an introduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course has increased my desire to learn a bit more about the engine. I don't think I'm close to starting my game, but I am looking forward
to learning more about what this tool can do - and how I'd be able to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How accurate is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joke is that applying to a job is an exercise in copy and pasting your resume into the application over
and over and over. I've submitted a ton of applications in the past month on my journey for an engineering
leadership role (reach out if you are looking for someone). Let's take a look at what I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke this down into 4 major categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No duplication: This type of application either took my resume or LinkedIn profile and didn't require me to fix any fields, re-entry anything, and generally "just worked". From a candidate's perspective, this is the ideal. A little over 10% of my applications fall into this category. A majority of these are using LinkedIn's Easy Apply. The downside I'm seeing, and will report on in a future post, is that the response rate for these types of applications has been very low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor Re-entry: I classified this is cleaning up or filling in up to three missing fields (but NOT job overviews). The most common thing I had to clean up was dates related to either a job or my degree. Some applicant systems want down to the day granularity, others are month granularity. My resume is to the month. The second most common fields to clean up are my degree and my address. For my degree, I see this on systems that have a predefined set of degrees to choose from. My Masters of Engineering is in Information Assurance from Iowa State University. This isn't a common degree title. My address is listed as city and state on my resume. Several ATSes want a full street address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single Section Duplication: This is a category that either requires me to reenter an entire job or entire educational history. This includes dates of employment, title, and description. There isn't a pattern on what goes missing when the resume is imported. I've had to re-enter jobs and degrees. It's not a single job that goes missing or a single degree. If I start seeing a clear pattern here, I'll dig a little deeper and see how I can clean up my resume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete re-entry: Here is the trope. One out of five of my applications have required re-entry of more than a single section to the point where I am just reentering everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Resume Re-entry results, a few weeks into my search" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/resume_reentry.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which ATS is responsible for most of those re-entries? MyWorkDay. Every single application I've put in that utilized this ATS required a full reentry. I've tried multiple resume formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhouse seems to be the easiest the use, especially when a company has taken time to embed it into their site with their branding, style sheets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company hasn't embedded the application into their site though, Lever has been better. When LinkedIn integration is set up, applying via LinkedIn and providing a resume has resulted in a very minor edits. The application updates after both steps - approving the Linkedin application and uploading the resume. Between those two, it's been only dates that I've had to change on those applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While completely re-entering your resume may not be the majority, fixing things up happens on 9 out of 10 of my applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has your experience been as a candidate? Are you re-entering your resume details this frequently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cross posted this over on LinkedIn. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-wegner_opentowork-candidateexperience-activity-6973272881879293952-eL8_/"&gt;Join me over there for the discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jobs"/><category term="job"/><category term="meta"/><category term="job search"/></entry><entry><title>What Job Source is using which ATS?</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/what-job-source-uses-which-ats.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-09-06T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-06T08:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-09-06:/what-job-source-uses-which-ats.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Talking through my current role search - Which Job Source is using which ATS?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="what-job-source-is-using-which-ats"&gt;What Job Source is using which ATS?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-job-source-is-using-which-ats" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a question that no one has asked me in my current search for a role, but it is information I have! It's been a few weeks since I started my hunt for a new engineering leadership role. It's time to start sharing some statistics that I'm seeing in this hunt. Today's information was originally to see if a specific job board favored a specific ATS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: Greenhouse and Lever are the most popular. I'm sure no one is surprised with that. I was surprised that so few roles posted on LinkedIn that are appearing my job alerts are using the Easy Apply feature though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe my next question should be: How many jobs have you applied to where you uploaded your resume and then had to type it in manually? Without looking at my data, I theorize it's over 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still looking for an engineering leadership role, but in the meantime, I'll share some occasional numbers from my search. Reach out to me if you are looking for a leader to join your engineering team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally and professionally, I've started bumping into &lt;a href="https://go.dev/"&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt; more and more. I've been told that
it's a good language to learn and know, but until &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/looking-for-new-role.html"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; I didn't have a lot of free time to dedicate
to learning a new language. With my down time now, I figure it'd be a great chance to pick up a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I turned to &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/"&gt;Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Grider on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 9 hour course (plus an hour or two for three self paced assignments). It goes from nothing (what's Go?) through
installation to writing way more than a simple Hello, World! Through out the lessons, the instructor is explaining what's
happening and why, not just throwing code into the IDE and having you run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course goes through two main projects, introducing new Go concepts along the way. The first is building a small program
that deals out a hand in a card game. You learn about variables, functions, receiver functions, structs, slices, unit tests, pointers
and more. Nothing feels overwhelming and it is a nice logical progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other project is a web site status checker, which introduces goroutines and channels. These are very important concepts in the language
and the example, while basic, is not contrived. It is very good at introducing there two features, showing common problems and how
to properly handle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, the instructor made use of the official documentation and showed how someone new to the language
should utilize it as well. This is an under rated skill and I hope that other engineers appreciate how useful it is to
be able to read official documentation and not immediately go to Stack Overflow for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a couple very minor complaints. First, the course is using a slightly older version of Go. In the version the
instructor is utilizing the &lt;code&gt;ioutil&lt;/code&gt; library is still in use. In the version I have installed, that has been deprecated. This
led to a few IDE warnings, and a quick search to determine how to fix it. Once that was resolved though, it was simple enough
to make the few changes needed locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other small complaint is the relatively short lessons. I love bite sized lessons, but when a lesson is between 4 and 10 minutes and the first
minute and last minute are spent summarizing the previous lesson and giving you and idea of what the next lesson will be,
there is a lot of time spend reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some down time right now and plan on learning a few more items on my back log. Stephen Grider has a nice library of courses
and several of them cover topics I'm interested in learning about. If they are set up the same way as this course, I think I'll
get a lot out of each of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was a perfect introduction to Go. It covered the basics, assumed that students have some programming knowledge and related
this "new" language to others you've probably utilized. It doesn't dig into the CS101 concepts, other than to briefly mention how certain
things are done (declare variable, function syntax, etc) and instead focuses on the aspects that make Go unique and useful as a language.&lt;/p&gt;

This was not entirely unexpected, as our customers started scaling back their hiring efforts it was imperative that Woven didn't outgrow what it was able to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the last few days to orient myself, and prepare for another job hunt. I'm looking for an Engineering Leadership role and would love an introduction if you could make one.

&lt;h2 id="before-we-begin"&gt;Before we begin...&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#before-we-begin" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is republished from &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/soft-skills-for-senior-software-developers/"&gt;Woven's blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked about what I thought the top soft skills - those hard to define traits - a senior engineer should possess to be successful. Below are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-list"&gt;The list&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-list" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="excellent-communication"&gt;Excellent communication&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#excellent-communication" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one lives in a vacuum. While portions of an engineerâs role may involve working alone, a senior engineer does not work in isolation. They interact with teammates, other teams, managers, end-users, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced developers have top-notch communication skills. Theyâre able to communicate effectively with individuals and teams to accomplish a common goal. Building relationships with these areas improves interactions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ownership-mentality"&gt;Ownership mentality&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ownership-mentality" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior software developer sees the dirty underbelly of the system. They embrace it. They work to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ideal candidate is taking ownership, tackling one task at a time to make the system slightly better. Not every change has to be big, flashy, and headline-grabbing; a change to improve stability is rarely commented on, but users notice if the system is unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, helping a customer through an issue doesnât always have to fall to âLevel 1 Supportâ. A senior engineer can and should spend time on support â learn the pain points users are having and use that knowledge to improve the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theyâre not too big for the small things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ethics"&gt;Ethics&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ethics" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineers know that what theyâre building will not only be used by them; it will impact others in some way, shape, or form. They consider that impact. They consider the unintentional impact, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking, âItâs just a system. Someone else is making the decision.â However, even the most simple systems have a ripple effect. Look for this type of critical thinking and awareness in your candidates and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="willingness-to-fail"&gt;Willingness to fail&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#willingness-to-fail" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has amazing new ideas. And not all ideas are going to be successful. (If they were, weâd all have several more commas in our bank accounts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure is an option and an opportunity to learn something new. Senior engineers chase ideas, explore hypotheses, and do unique things. If they fail, they learn something from it. Theyâre open to admitting mistakes and take constructive feedback easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use this knowledge to help their team learn something, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="openness-to-discussion"&gt;Openness to discussion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#openness-to-discussion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are your senior engineers willing to have their ideas challenged? They should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion around how something works now versus how it can work in the future helps everyone improve and helps the system get better over time. This should not be an antagonistic discussion but instead reflect the different options other developers can bring forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly, these discussions result in a broader perspective and even better ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mentorship"&gt;Mentorship&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mentorship" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior engineer has a position of trust on the team. They should use this position to guide more junior team members, inviting them to larger discussions and helping them grow professionally. Patience is key as junior devs ask questions and turn those questions into learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom calls donât have to be scheduled and they donât have to be an hour long. If a senior engineer hops on a call when theyâre troubleshooting and invites team members to join, observe, and ask questions, theyâre the right person for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="time-management"&gt;Time management&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#time-management" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadlines are a part of life. A software engineer with good time management skills helps set those deadlines through effective communication with the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also know how to make decisions on prioritization; if (and when) they miss a deadline, it shouldnât be a surprise to management. Software engineering leaders are time conscious and make sure everyone is aware of timelines and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="empathy"&gt;Empathy&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#empathy" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This oneâs a hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees arenât machines. They have feelings, ups and downs, and life events outside of their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional intelligence is important â  especially in a remote work environment â  to building a great professional relationship. Experienced engineers take time to get to know their coworkers and their customers as people, not just as a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="leadership"&gt;Leadership&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#leadership" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person doesnât need to have âEngineering Managerâ in their title to be a leader. Leaders can take many different forms, and the most important part is being able to inspire those around them. This could be by driving technical discussions, being a great mentor, or simply having an idea and knowing how to get buy-in and execute on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders make things happen, and they donât wait for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="creativity"&gt;Creativity&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#creativity" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced tech world, engineers must be able to take a step back, see the big picture, and think outside the box. They canât be afraid to try new things or challenge the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often itâs unorthodox approaches that lead to breakthroughs and a final product thatâs worthy of usersâ time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software development is a team sport. The best players are the ones who make those around them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be truly successful, your senior engineers should have a mix of both hard skills (like coding) and soft skills (like problem-solving). These are the people who will take your company to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"/><category term="job"/><category term="meta"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>Time and Gas saved by switching to remote work</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/time-gas-saved-with-remote-work.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-06-12T01:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-12T01:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-06-12:/time-gas-saved-with-remote-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nearing 5 years of full time remote, a look back on what this has saved me in terms of time commuting and gas&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="a-brief-history"&gt;A brief history&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August of 2017, I left a decade long career that consisted of driving at least 90 minutes every day. During construction, poor weather or winter weather it was closer to two hours daily. I discussed this as &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-decade-at-caterpillar.html#the-long-drive"&gt;one of the factors&lt;/a&gt; in my initial search for a new role at the time. I also briefly covered it in &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-found-an-awesome-remote-only-job.html#full-time-work-from-home"&gt;my reflection&lt;/a&gt; on how I found that role. An hour and a half to two hours daily adds up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm quickly approaching half a decade of full time remote work. I spent a majority of that at &lt;a href="https://packetfabric.com"&gt;PacketFabric&lt;/a&gt; and recently started at &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven&lt;/a&gt; (still need to post about the new role). I wanted to see what I've saved in terms of time commuting, gallons of gasoline and maybe a few other interesting stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="starting-numbers"&gt;Starting Numbers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#starting-numbers" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I can do some of these calculations, I needed to get some starting numbers. I'm not trying to calculate to the penny or to the minute, so these are rough averages. However, over the course of 5 years, a couple extra minutes every day add up quickly. These numbers assume I would have stayed at that same office, same house, and accumulated vacation time the same way I was while still employed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1089&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Average&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;MPG&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also needed to find an average gas price. While starting to write this post I thought I'd pull official numbers from the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&amp;amp;f=w"&gt;US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;. They have numbers going back to 1993 broken down by week. This would be amazing, but I was spending to much time trying to figure out when I was on vacation and how to handle weeks with a holiday in it. I don't need exact numbers. I'm looking for ball park, so instead I went with the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&amp;amp;f=a"&gt;yearly gas price average for 2017 through 2021&lt;/a&gt; then I used the &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm"&gt;inflation calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt; to adjust for inflation using May of that year to May of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.07&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.57&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.37&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2022&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;average&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;January&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;May&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2022&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets an average gas price of &lt;code&gt;$3.21&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably important to note that if I run this again in August at the full 5 year mark that gas cost is going to be much higher. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html"&gt;Inflation was 8.6% in May 2022&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html"&gt;average gas prices hitting $5.00 nationwide&lt;/a&gt;. In my area, it's been above $5 for over a month. This is also part of the reason I wanted to run these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I wanted to see if I could figure out how much CO2 I had not produced based on how much gasoline I hadn't used. I was expecting a complicated formula. Turns out that &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#burning"&gt;1 Gallon of Gas = 19.59 pounds of CO2&lt;/a&gt; (8,887 grams of CO2 per gallon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-calculations"&gt;The calculations&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-calculations" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my initial numbers determined, the calculations are pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Total Miles Not Driven = Miles per day &lt;span class="gs"&gt;* Total number of work days&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gs"&gt;                       = 90 *&lt;/span&gt; 1089
                       = 98,010 miles

Total Time Not Commuting = Commute time per day (minutes) &lt;span class="gs"&gt;* Total number of days&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gs"&gt;                         = 106 *&lt;/span&gt; 1089
                         = 115,434 minutes
                         = 1923.9 hours
                         = 80.1 days

Gallons of Gas Not used = Total Miles Not Driven / Average MPG
                        = 98,010 / 22.5
                        = 4,356 gallons of gasoline

Dollars not spent on gas = Gallons of Gas Not used &lt;span class="gs"&gt;* Average gas price&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gs"&gt;                         = 4,356 *&lt;/span&gt; 3.21
                         = $13,997.28

CO2 Not produced = Gallons of Gas Not Used &lt;span class="gs"&gt;* 19.59&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gs"&gt;                 = 4,356 *&lt;/span&gt; 19.59
                 = 85,334.04 pounds of CO2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="analysis"&gt;Analysis&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#analysis" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are some impressive numbers. I saved almost 100,000 miles of commute time just going to and from work over five years. Put another way - I was NOT in my car for 80 full days over the course of five years. Literally a full time job's worth of travel time at nearly 2,000 hours saved over 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't put over 4,300 gallons of gas in the vehicle and I didn't spend almost $14,000 on gasoline. That also prevented the production of 85,000 pounds of CO2. Sounds like a big number, but it's a passenger vehicle. It doesn't compare to the output of a large truck, an airplane, a tanker, or a factory. But, it's something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just the easily calculable numbers on what shifting to remote work has saved me. Things that I can't put a number on: time with family, flexible scheduling, ability to take the dogs for a walk when the sun is out, and more. I'm not spending hours in a car. I'm at home when the family gets home from school and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't tried to put hard numbers on this before, but now that I have, I am even more satisfied with my decision five years ago to start looking for a company that was 100% remote.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jobs"/><category term="job"/><category term="meta"/></entry><entry><title>The Other Side of the Mirror: How I Went from Woven Client to Woven Employee</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-06-04T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-04T08:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-06-04:/woven-client-to-woven-employee.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My conversation with Woven on how I went from one of their customers to their Director of Engineering&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="before-we-begin"&gt;Before we begin...&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#before-we-begin" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is republished from &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/the-other-side-of-the-mirror-how-andy-wegner-went-from-woven-client-to-woven-employee/"&gt;Woven's blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in April 2022, I left my position at PacketFabric, which I've talked about a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-decade-at-caterpillar.html#the-new-job"&gt;handful of times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-found-an-awesome-remote-only-job.html"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;. At some point I'll do a post-mortem on the job and why it was time to move on, but that's not for today. This post is about how I went from a customer of &lt;a href="https://www.woventeams.com/"&gt;Woven&lt;/a&gt; to Woven's Director of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I spin up in this role, I'm looking forward to growing with the team and helping other engineering leaders find amazing new members for their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-conversation"&gt;The conversation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-conversation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: Thanks for sitting down with me, Andy. Could you tell me a little bit about your background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. I started at Cat Logistics doing inbound transportation, which went from a single division to five or six divisions by the time I was done. In 2017 I transitioned into building the QA team at PacketFabric, and that expanded into building the software engineering team itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined when there were six or seven engineers, and I was the first one on the QA side. When the company went through their next round of funding I was the one that led the software engineering growth. So we worked with Woven to hire roughly 20 engineers in about 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tooling-before-woven"&gt;Tooling before Woven&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#tooling-before-woven" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: Had you used a technical assessment tool before Woven?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Woven we were using just a standard take-home test. We built a rubric, we built the scenario, and we handed it out to the people we wanted to move forward in the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is itâs very, very time-consuming. It means that me or another engineer is constantly following up. âHey, are you going to take this today? Are you going to get this done? We sent this a week ago.â And we had to spend time writing it, too. I also had to make sure they were all evaluated uniformly because if not, youâre not getting any value out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not something that a small team can do when they need to grow quickly, which is where Woven came in. Woven was very helpful in getting us a set of scenarios that matched what we needed. One of them matched exactly what we were hiring for; the calculating and billing invoices was exactly what we needed a couple of engineers to build. So it was very, very fortuitous in that case. Woven made evaluating those candidates very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things like debugging and systems architecture were very helpful in identifying the senior engineers we were looking for at the time, because we were growing quickly. And Woven was able to identify a senior engineer versus somebody that had some experience but hadnât done the full gambit of work that a senior engineer would have done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Woven really grew to cover most of engineering because it was so successful in bringing in high-quality engineers with very low turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="candidate-experience"&gt;Candidate experience&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#candidate-experience" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: Did you hear any feedback from candidates about their experience using the platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, constantly. Especially from engineers in the calculating and billing invoices area. You know, they thought this was just a scenario that was built up, but it was actually focused on what they would be doing. There was a lot of feedback like, âThis is not just a code challenge. This feels like real work.â Those types of things were said constantly throughout the interview process, and we didnât solicit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most I usually said was, âYou should have received feedback, was there anything you wanted to discuss?â And their response was kinda like, âNo, it was very good and very thorough.â They were appreciative of feedback because most candidates have gone through more than one interview at this point, especially the senior engineers, and often theyâre just ghosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="puzzles"&gt;Puzzles&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#puzzles" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: Iâm sure as the candidate it doesnât feel good to get ghosted or to spend time doing something that doesnât matter. Especially when youâre really experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. As a hiring manager, I have zero interest in puzzle questions. Theyâre not helpful to me. It feels like Iâm wasting their time and my time. When candidates are able to see and do projects that feel real, itâs important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If theyâre just doing a puzzle, they donât get a sense of what we want to do. And with Woven, theyâre getting well-defined scenarios that are picked by a hiring committee and focus on what the role is supposed to cover. You know a senior engineer is going to be doing debugging and is going to be looking at architecture. It may not be our exact system, but itâs pretty close and youâre going to be doing this type of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve done puzzles when Iâve interviewed, and I hate giving puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: I imagine a lot of people in your position would say that. Why would you give a candidate something that you wouldnât want to take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. If I was interviewing for this role, I would not want to do a puzzle. I had to go through the Woven test as I was applying here. And I was like âOkay, Iâve seen the other side. Iâve gone through this. This is exactly what other candidates have said.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="moving-to-woven"&gt;Moving to Woven&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#moving-to-woven" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: Tell me about that â transitioning from using Woven as a service to going through the interview process and becoming an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing that I learned is that Wovenâs engineering team is a lot smaller than I thought. Because when I would have a question or an issue, it would get solved really quickly. So I thought there was a much larger team. But it points to how good the engineering team is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going through the interview process was fun. Obviously I knew very high-level what it looks like, how it operates. I knew what was going on behind the scenes. But I was nervous because even though I knew what the test was going to look like, I donât know exactly how I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got the feedback and it was really good. There were a few areas that I definitely could have done better and Woven caught all of it. So I was very happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving over here is really like looking through the other side of the mirror. Itâs interesting to see how things actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-side-of-the-mirror"&gt;Other side of the mirror&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#other-side-of-the-mirror" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: As someone whoâs been on both sides of the mirror, what would you say to other VPs is the main benefit of using Woven?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a hiring manager perspective, Iâd talk about how much time is saved from when my team was doing their own evaluations to when Woven was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very easy to see the teams that were hiring using Woven versus the teams that were building their own scenario take-home tests. The efficiency was so much higher with the Woven teams. They could get through more candidates and they could get higher-quality candidates to the later stages versus the teams that would be doing their own take-homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to tell people I hired non-engineers that were among the top performing engineers on the team. People that I would have missed just looking at the resume. Somebody that you wouldnât think could do a good job as a senior engineer, but they received some of the best scores on the Woven assessments and turned around and produced some of the highest-quality work. Just looking at a resume though, they would have been passed over pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes this kind of candidate has done and learned just a little bit more than somebody with a traditional CS degree that probably hasnât used data structures in their day to day job. Instead theyâve focused on building a product that works and functions. And this candidate thatâs from another career had to jump in and solve the problem, and that problem was very complex. They taught themselves and found that it was something they really enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the hidden gems aspect of Woven is very surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thats-a-wrap"&gt;That's a wrap&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thats-a-wrap" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the conversation is over. I'm enjoying my role at Woven. There are a lot of ways to make the hiring process better in the tech industry and I'm going to be right there helping.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jobs"/><category term="job"/><category term="meta"/><category term="leadership"/></entry><entry><title>Run Sanic on Heroku</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/run-sanic-on-heroku.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-05-19T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2022-05-19:/run-sanic-on-heroku.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick guide on how to launch a small Sanic application on Heroku&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I needed to set up a very simple proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate to myself and eventually my team that an idea would work. A POC isn't production ready, it doesn't need to be robust and in my case wasn't even going to be written using the same framework we use in production. I just needed to see if the integration would work as I thought it would. If it did, I'd work with my team to build a production ready version. If it didn't work, no problem. I expected this POC to take about two hours of my time, including initial research around the integration itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background is utilizing Python. I've been using it for nearly 15 years now. In my previous role I utilized &lt;a href="https://sanic.dev/en/"&gt;Sanic&lt;/a&gt; to build our API. I've also used Django and Flask in the path, but it had been five or more years so I was rusty in those. Plus, I have a fancy new book written by Adam Hopkins, the core developer of Sanic and an amazing former colleague, called &lt;a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-web-development-with-sanic/9781801814416"&gt;Python Web Development with Sanic&lt;/a&gt; that I wanted to work through. I've been meaning to get to this, and haven't had a lot of time with my recent job change. This small POC won't get far, but I've found that if I start following a long tutorial or course or book, I'll dedicate more time so that I can finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I highly recommend the book if you are utilizing Sanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: This post was written and utilized a free Heroku Dyno. On August 25, 2022, it was &lt;a href="https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter"&gt;announced that the free tier would be going away&lt;/a&gt; on November 28, 2022. All of this will continue to work, but you won't be able to utilize the free tier to try it out after that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="problem"&gt;Problem&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#problem" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I encounted during this POC wasn't the integration, like I expected. Instead, the problem I ran into was figuring out where I could deploy this POC at no cost. I considered &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/"&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt;, but that meant leaving something running on my machine until my team had a chance to play with the POC. Instead, I turned to &lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. The next problem I ran into was determining how to deploy a Sanic application to Heroku. Google returned 5 year old articles, forum posts that don't have answers (&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/979/"&gt;denvercoder9&lt;/a&gt;, is that you?), and Flask tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="toy-sanic-app"&gt;Toy Sanic App&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#toy-sanic-app" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the solution, here is a toy Sanic app that simply prints &lt;code&gt;Ok!&lt;/code&gt; when you hit the root endpoint. Save this in a file called &lt;code&gt;server.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;sanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sanic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;sanic.response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;root_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Ok!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"0.0.0.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PORT"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;access_log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one important thing to notice is that &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt; parameter in &lt;code&gt;app.run()&lt;/code&gt;. Heroku supplies the port it is listening on on an environment variable, and this is needed for Sanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-quick-solution"&gt;The quick solution&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-quick-solution" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Adam's book, in the "Organizing a Project" chapter, he shows that running an application uses a command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sanic src.server:app -p 7777 --debug --workers=2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying that command a bit and setting up the Heroku &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; (capitization matters and no extension) I have a single line in my &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; that reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file with Sanic as an item was also required. If you're using a virtualenv, you can simply &lt;code&gt;pip freeze &amp;gt; requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; to get everything in your environment into the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, my directory looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;./poc
    Procfile
    requirements.txt
    server.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push this to Heroku and the application fires right up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="more-details"&gt;More details&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#more-details" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not have a personal Heroku account or the CLI installed on my machine before starting. That was easily resolved by creating an account at &lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. For the &lt;code&gt;heroku-cli&lt;/code&gt;, I followed the &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#standalone-installation-with-a-tarball"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to get that set up. Namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This does require &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that's done, I verified the installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;heroku&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--version
heroku/7.60.2&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;linux-x64&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;node-v14.19.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up the new application in your Heroku account by logging in. Then click &lt;code&gt;New&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Create new app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Create new heroku app - New / Create new app" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/sanic-heroku-new-app.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter a unique application name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then add Python to the build path. Do this by going to &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Add buildpack&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Selecting Python and clicking save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Add Python buildpack - Settings / Add buildpack / Python" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/sanic-heroku-buildpack.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is setting up the two files I mentioned earlier - &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Since the &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; is a single line for this simple proof of concept, that can been done in a single line from the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"web: sanic server:app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Procfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you've been using a virtualenv - because you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be using a virtualenv - the &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file is just as easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;freeze&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is setup and ready to be loaded to Heroku. Next, login in your terminal. I used the browser based method, but you can do this entirely in the command line if you wish. My command was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, I set up a heroku git remote endpoint so that I could push&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku git:remote -a NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APP
git add .
git commit -m "Deployment commit"
git push heroku master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change &lt;code&gt;NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APP&lt;/code&gt; to match the name you input in the UI when setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute or so, and then navigate to &lt;code&gt;NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APP.herokuapp.com&lt;/code&gt; and see &lt;code&gt;Ok!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finishing-up"&gt;Finishing up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#finishing-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the steps above, I got a very simple Sanic proof of concept running on Heroku in a matter of minutes. This was very helpful as I was able to easily show my team that the work we're thinking of doing can be accomplished. All told, my proof of concept took two hours of time. The next step will be building a production version.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of GitLab's 'How to Manage a Remote Team' Coursera course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/gitlab-manage-remote-team.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-10-26T09:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-26T09:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2020-10-26:/gitlab-manage-remote-team.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of Gitlab's Coursera course on managing a remote team and workforce&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; - both the product and the company. As the largest all remote workforce,
they are in an enviable position of being an expert on how to manage a team of over 1000 global employees without
having an office. My current position puts me in charge of managing a global, remote, workforce as well but on a
smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When GitLab announced they were releasing a course on &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/remote-team-management"&gt;How to Manage a Remote Team&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera, I jumped at the
opportunity to take it. I want to expand my skill set as a manager of remote employees and the chance to learn some
best practices from GitLab in this area was a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is split up in to a four week set of lessons and covers about 11-12 hours of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 1 covers Remote Best Practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 2 covers Managing Remote Teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 3 covers Remote Adaption Processes for Organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 4 covers Culture and Values for Distributed Teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final task then is building a remote transition plan for an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these were well done. The videos are presented by various GitLab employees and cover a variety
of different aspects in each section. There are various readings assigned too. These provide a ton of information,
especially &lt;a href="https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work"&gt;The Remote Playbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some GitLab centric information provided and back patting, but it is done in a way that helps to
show &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; certain things are needed - like open and transparent documentation. By the end of the course, you will
know that GitLab has an open handbook for everyone to read and you will know why you should as well. This type
of thing is expected and knowing that the instructors will do some back patting is important too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final project - building a remote transition plan - is peer reviewed. You are presented with a series of questions,
which you answer with a short essay for each and using information presented during the course. When you are done, the last
task you have is to peer review three of your cohort's projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was information dense and useful. The time estimate is off as the videos take only about an hour each week. Either
I am a faster reader than I thought or they have overestimated the time it would take to read the weekly material. In either
case, I estimate that I spent about 6 hours. It was also nice that, although the course is split into weeks, everything is
available immediately upon completing the previous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this course to anyone who manages a team remotely or who is in the process of transitioning to remote work. COVID
has given the entire world a crash course in remote work, but this course is a good way to handle and manage those newly remote
workers effectively. It is also a good course to take if your company is planning on extending the work remote environment that
2020 has thrust upon you to last beyond this current pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab has done a good job with this course.&lt;/p&gt;

What is my final opinion?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I close out this series with a quick run down of everything, I want to
congratulate &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/rise-gardens-raises-seed-funding-for-a-indoor-hydroponic-gardening-system/"&gt;Rise Gardens on closing a round of funding&lt;/a&gt; to the tune of $2.6M this
week. Well done, Rise Gardens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this series a little over a month ago to document my new &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt; indoor garden.
I've covered everything from the [initial opening of the garden][unboxgarden], &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;garden assembly&lt;/a&gt;,
to [planting the first plants][plants]. I've covered the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-physical.html"&gt;hardware of the garden&lt;/a&gt; and
the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html"&gt;software and subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, I've watched my plants
sprout, grow and been harvested (at least some).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="harvest"&gt;Harvest&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#harvest" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month isn't a lot of time for larger plants to grow. My tomatoes and peppers aren't even close to
being ready, but several varieties of lettuce have been for a while. I've had the butter lettuce,
romaine, and red oak already. My arugula is two days away from being ready, according to the app. I think it's
more likely that it's about a week away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each variety has been good. I have favorites, based on tastes, but no complaints about the quality
or taste of the lettuce. Surprisingly, the kids liked all of them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="5 weeks into growth" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/7_final_review/garden_now.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five weeks into growing, and I have a decent crop growing. On the bottom, there is a couple tomato plants,
some pepper plants, a swiss chard (almost to harvest too), and a tiny little kale plant. I finally got one
of those to sprout. That was my last kale pod, so I'm happy at least one sprouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle there are two basil plants and two chamomile plants. I've got a nursery started with some plants
that will go in this area in about a week and a half. At the top is my lettuce. In this picture, I'd just removed
two pods that had been completely harvested so it is a bit emptier than it had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bottom, you can see that I ran some twine to help hold up the plants. This was put in place to help the
tomatoes before their stalks thickened. They had been leaning. Now that they are tall and thick though, they
aren't even touching that twine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="customer-support"&gt;Customer Support&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#customer-support" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't remember mentioning this in previous posts, but Rise Gardens has good customer support. I've reached out to
them a few times for various questions. Each time I get a response within a couple days and have had my questions
answered. They are friendly and know what they are talking about. Keep doing this Rise Gardens! As you grow, keep
that focus on the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="correction"&gt;Correction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#correction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my post about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;assembling the garden&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned that there is a gap that appears when you
place the small tray covers in place. It turns out, I was putting those trays on backward. This was pointed
out to be by another Rise Garden owner. Thank you for your help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the picture above, you can see I have those trays in place correctly now. You can also see a long white
stain on the second level that is clearly coming from the exit pipe. This is due to the splashing the water
was doing before I turned the covers around and the lime in my water. When I clean the garden, this will get
cleaned off too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-summary"&gt;Final Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise Gardens has built an amazing product. It's not going to replace your trips to the grocery store. One garden
isn't going to feed your family. But, it will supplement it. It will provide you with some fresh vegetables and herbs.
It will allow you to grow for more of the year (especially in colder climates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also proved to be very interesting for the kids. They love checking the garden each morning to see how big
plants have gotten or how "their" plant is doing. They help out when nutrients are put in and like refilling the
water with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few areas that can be improved though. I think the biggest improvement that could be made, physically, is
adding leveling feet. If the next iteration has adjustable feet, that solves the largest problem I had during assembly:
how do I make this thing level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other areas of improvement are related to the software and subscription service. I mentioned these in my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html"&gt;post
about the software&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I think the suggested times are a bit aggressive for plant harvesting.
I'm continuing to watch, but based on the lettuces that have been harvested so far, the software tells me they are ready
much earlier than they are. The subscription service could use a few additional features - mainly the ability to schedule
selections out a few months and the newest seeds. I still don't see those and I think I'm going to miss them for June, because
my shipping day is soon. I'll try again for July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the wishlist of items I have, I'm hoping the round of funding they received can be partially used to meet some of these.
On the software side, I'd love an API to pull back previous readings. On the hardware side, a light sensor and more lighting
options would be amazing. If I had to pick between the two, I'd pick that API though...I am a programmer, so take that
opinion with that bias in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="would-i-get-it-again"&gt;Would I get it again?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#would-i-get-it-again" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely would get this again. This is a great in door garden. It grows way more than herbs. It's large enough to grow big
plants. It's expandable to grow &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; plants. It's easy enough to not kill plants. With a few improvements, I'd have no complaints
at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-oct-2020"&gt;Update: Oct. 2020&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#update-oct-2020" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first full harvest took place in late August/early September. I was reasonably pleased with most of the plants. I started
the second crop a couple weeks ago, hoping to put some lessons learned into practice to do ever better this round. A few problems
I had with my first crop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I planted to many tomato and pepper plants. They grow larger than the shelf space and started growing up the sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I planted kale about two weeks after my first batch of seeds and by the time it was transferred to the garden it was tiny and overwhelmed by larger plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cucumbers had a lot of buds, but few fruits. I think this is because I didn't prune well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pepper plants grew very large, produced many flowers, but didn't product a single pepper. I suspect part of this is due to pollination and competition with the tomatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this second crop, I've spread of the plants that grow large much more and will end up having empty space in the garden because they will
quickly overwhelm the other plants. I've put lettuce and herbs on the top shelf and filled it reasonably well. I've put two cucumber plants on the middle
shelf and will work on pruning them better and shaping the direction they grow so that they remain on this level instead of growing everywhere. Finally, I'm
only doing one tomato and one pepper plant this time. I'm hopeful that I get some peppers. The tomatoes were very good, but with only one plant I am hoping
it have more room to grow and less competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Rise Gardens App/Subscription Improvement suggestions</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-05-24T23:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-24T23:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2020-05-24:/rise-garden-suggestions-software.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several suggestion for the Rise Gardens app, their subscription service and product as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [garden has been opened][unboxgarden]. The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;garden has been assembled&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;nurseries were
opened&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-planting.html"&gt;first plants have sprouted&lt;/a&gt;. I've had my first lecture harvest (more on
this next time). While waiting for that harvest, I offered suggestion on how to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-physical.html"&gt;improve the hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after about a month of growing, monitoring and watching the sprout go from seed to plate, I've been
using the application almost daily. I have thoughts on how to make it even better. I have thoughts on how to make
the subscription service better. I'll share those below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mobile-application"&gt;Mobile Application&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mobile-application" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the selling points of the &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt; is the mobile application. It's built to
help you maintain your garden. For the most part, it works well. But there are some warts that need to
be ironed out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using the Android application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="loading-screen"&gt;Loading Screen&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#loading-screen" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching the application presents you with the Rise Gardens splash screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rise Garden App splash screen" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/6_app_suggestions/riseapp-loading.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to love this splash screen. On a good day, it will show for a few seconds. On a bad day, the application will
hang forever. There is a simple work around, force close the application and relaunch it, but that's rather annoying.
I estimate that I encounter this problem every three to four times I launch the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="login-screen"&gt;Login Screen&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#login-screen" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I've made it past the loading screen, I find that every four to five days my log in information is forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rise Garden App login" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/6_app_suggestions/riseapp-login.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, every few days I have to log back in. It's also important to point out here that this log in is not
the same as the login you use on their website. My login on the website contains a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;. The application
rejects that form of email address. Since I usually use &lt;code&gt;+servicename&lt;/code&gt; to keep my login information easier
to remember, this is rather annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can stay logged into Slack, Hangouts, Gmail, NextCloud, and countless other applications on my phone
indefinitely. I should be able to do that same here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="plant-information"&gt;Plant Information&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#plant-information" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about the application, in addition to it's ability to tell me how many and what kind
of nutrients to add, is suggestions on how when to harvest your plants. Unfortunately, I don't think it's
very accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accuracy is something I'm aware of and am keeping in mind as I add nutrients too. If I can't trust one
area, can I really trust the other? So far, with four different types of lettuce harvested, I don't see a
reason not to trust it, but that thought is still in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it inaccurate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Red Oak Harvest Day Suggestion" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/6_app_suggestions/redoak-harvest-day-app.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On harvest day, this is the information presented by the application. There are a few things to
notice in this screen shot. First, "0 days to harvest", yet still showing the "Mid-growth" data.
Second, this didn't change to "harvest" until a full day later. Thinking about it now, I suspect
the datetime of when I added the plant to a nursery was recorded, not just the day and it's going
by "hours since planted", to display the stage information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Red Oak on Harvest Day" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/6_app_suggestions/redoak-harvest-day.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the red oak lettuce on harvest day. This...is not ready. I will fully admit that I am not
an experienced gardener, but this is a tiny little plant. I waited almost two full weeks after this
picture was taken to actually harvest the plant. It had grown much larger by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the same type of problem with all of my lettuces. They all reached "Harvest day", but
were not ready to be harvested. The other plants I have in the garden at the moment are
longer growing and aren't to the flowering stages yet, so I'll watch for those stages in the
application versus reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="subscription-service"&gt;Subscription Service&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#subscription-service" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really like about Rise Gardens so far is the monthly subscription service,
which sends plants that I've selected and nutrients to grow them. My shipping date for May
just missed their newest plants, but I'm looking forward to getting a few of those in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I do have a few suggestions for how to make the subscription service amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="multipacks"&gt;Multipacks&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#multipacks" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I was sent during the shipping delays was variety packs of seeds.
I covered these in my post where I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;opened the nurseries&lt;/a&gt;. The subscription
service doesn't allow this type of package. Instead, it ships four pods of an identical
plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to try mint, or cat nip or a couple herbs that I haven't had or use very infrequently,
but I don't need four pods of these plants. Instead, if I could create my own
variety packs I'd be more willing to try some newer plants. This is how I got the
red oak lettuce and the kale that is in the garden now. I wouldn't have gotten four
pods of either of those, since that's just not what I need (or want, in the case of kale). But a
single pod...sure. Might as well, and the kids can try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="plan-out-multiple-months"&gt;Plan out multiple months&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#plan-out-multiple-months" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants are shipped out once a month. About ten days before that, I receive an email saying
that my shipment is coming up. Five days before shipping I have the ability to go pick the
plants I want and they are immediately locked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love if this flow could go out multiple months. Instead of worrying about making sure
I hit that five day window to make selections, let me pick the plants I want for the next three
months or so and allow me to change those until a few days before shipping. Then I know what I'm going
to be getting and if I decide that I don't like something or want to try something else in a
few months I can still go change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="subscription-plants-vs-store-plants"&gt;Subscription plants vs Store plants&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#subscription-plants-vs-store-plants" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed the availability of new plants for my May shipment. I was looking forward to trying some of
these for June. It turns out, the new plants aren't listed in the list of plants I can
select for my subscription. This is incredibly disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wishlist"&gt;Wishlist&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#wishlist" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two items that I really think would make Rise Gardens fantastic and both are software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="access-to-old-water-readings"&gt;Access to old water readings&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#access-to-old-water-readings" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the application sending my water readings somewhere. I have to log in, and the
application doesn't work when the internet is down (tried...doesn't load). Give us the ability
to pull those old readings via an API call so that I can plot them. I love data and I love
visualizing date. More information via an API call would be even better. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long the lights were on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggested nutrients to add&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggested pH balance to add&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if enough people can see and play with their old data we can even make some suggestions
on what would work better. As it stands though, we don't have access to it. We put in water readings
and that's it. It's gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd really love the ability to pull that old data back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="allow-better-light-control"&gt;Allow better light control&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#allow-better-light-control" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now light control is pretty limited. You pick a time for them to turn on and a number
of hours for them to stay on. That's it. (The hour thing is why I thought about when the
plant status shifted from "Mid-growth" to "Harvest" as well)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Light control" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/6_app_suggestions/light-schedule.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like the ability to be able to turn these lights on and off through out the day. As the sun
crosses the sky, there are hours where the plants are in direct sunlight. I could turn the lights
down to 50% intensity during those hours or off all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two open ports on the controller. A piece of hardware that can detect light level
could be used to control on/off or light intensity level. Obviously you couldn't put there right next
to a plant, because the LEDs would affect the sensor, but put it on a post and it could tell if you if
the sun was shining on the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of thing could also be used in different seasons to determine when to turn the lights on
or off automatically. I can use natural light for part of the day, but when the days get shorter, I need the
lights to stay on longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm nearly done with this series. I am only planning one last post - a final summary of everything
so far and a quick summary of first harvests (I think it'll only be lettuce at that point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I've covered the things that have frustrated me (application loading/login), things that
can be improved (plant information) and offered a few suggestions to make the software and subscription better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think everything I've mentioned is do able with some development time. I am looking forward to
how Rise Gardens continues to improve the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is very disappointing though, is that the new plants - cucumbers, bean mascotte, celery, catnip, and
several more - aren't even available as options when selecting my next subscription plants. I hope this is
resolved soon, because I really want to try some of these new plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next post will be the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-final-review.html"&gt;last in the series&lt;/a&gt; and will cover harvest and my final, overall impressions of the garden.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Rise Gardens physical improvements suggestions</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-physical.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-05-05T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-05T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2020-05-05:/rise-garden-suggestions-physical.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everything is set up and sprouting. While I'm waiting for a harvest, I have some thoughts on how to make the new garden even better.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html"&gt;opened the garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;opened the nurseries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;assembled the garden&lt;/a&gt;.
I've &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-planting.html"&gt;planted my first pods&lt;/a&gt; and am now eagerly awaiting a harvest from the new &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt; garden.
While waiting, I have some time on my hands, so this post is an overview on what I really like and what I think can be improved.
I'm going to just cover the physical garden in this post, and in the next one I'll go over some improvements that would make
the mobile application and subscription service amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="improvements"&gt;Improvements&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#improvements" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with what hasn't been great. It's customary to do good news, then bad news, but overall I am
very pleased with the garden so far. Granted, I'm not even at my first harvest yet, but first impressions
have been good. I wanted to end the post on the "good" things about the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="packaging"&gt;Packaging&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#packaging" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging has been a mixed bag. Packaging of seed pods and nutrients, has been flawless. Packaging of the garden, itself,
was less so. As I pointed out in my post where I [opened the garden][unboxgarden], there were areas where packaging just
didn't hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Loose screws" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/5_suggestions/scratched_tray.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screws broke out of their paper bag and scattered all over the inside of the tray. This particular tray has a few scratches on it
that the other two levels do not. I presume it is from the sliding screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suggestion here is to either put the screws into a plastic bag instead of the paper one, or put the paper bag of screws into
a little box. A box the size the pods arrive in would be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Scratched Top" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/5_suggestions/scratched_top.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top shelf was also scratched. This was stored right next to the bottom shelf - with drawers - and both parts are
metal. I assume they rubbed together during shipping, causing the scratch. I think the easiest way to prevent this would
be to add some small barrier between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Antenna Smudge" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/5_suggestions/smudged_anntena.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the packaging complaints, we return to the small little antenna. This looks like it was picked from a warehouse
bin by a worker with dirty hands. That's not uncommon for that line of work. My suggestion, in this case, is to have the antennas
stored in some kind of protection - a small plastic bag, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="seeds"&gt;Seeds&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#seeds" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now about three weeks into my first set of plants, and while a majority of them sprouted, there were several that did not. I know that
not all seeds will sprout, but if I'm getting only four pods of seeds per box and one of those doesn't sprout, that's an
expensive failure rate over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first transplanting, 7 out of 18 plants didn't sprout after 10 days. After 14 days, those seven still had not sprouted,
but a new set of pods had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't have a suggestion on how to improve this right now. As I watch the next round of plants, and my May seeds
when they arrive, I'll be watching failure rate carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, this is my biggest and only major complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adjustable-feet"&gt;Adjustable Feet&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#adjustable-feet" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three items that I think would make an immediate improvement on how the system is physically assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lack of adjustable feet" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/5_suggestions/cardboard_level.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;assembly post&lt;/a&gt;, was that the area my garden sits in is not perfectly level.
The garden needs to be level though, so that the water flows correctly. My solution to this was cardboard box slices the
length of the foot, so that we could level it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suggestion though, is to add adjustable feet. This eliminates the need for users to come up with a way to level a
garden that is 50+ pounds that isn't supported by the company. It'd also look much nicer than 6-7 slices of cardboard
stuffed under one leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="light-sensor"&gt;Light Sensor&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#light-sensor" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next item on my wishlist would be a light sensor. The controller has two unused ports. A light sensor could fit into one
of those ports and could be used to automatically decide if the overhead lights should be on and at what intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the year passes, the sun rises and sets at different times of day. I received my garden after day light saving kicked in this
year, but I am curious how it handles that too. Right now, the lights are controlled by the application to come on at a specific time,
stay one for a specific number of hours and then turn off. My garden receives sunlight throughout the day. I'd like to use the overhead
lights to augment that natural light. If it's a cloudy day - turn on the lights. If it's during that time of day where the sun goes
over the corner of the room so the garden is in shade, turn on the lights. If it's early in the morning and the sun is shining on the
plants, but it's just not the intensity recommended, turn on the lights at an appropriate intensity to augment the sun. As it rises and
places the garden in more direct sunlight, lower the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wire-harness-around-controller"&gt;Wire harness around controller&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#wire-harness-around-controller" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden has some nice groves built into it to hide the wiring for the lights. It works really well and makes the garden look
nice when you are looking at the plants, or showing off to family members. But, this nice wiring solution doesn't exist once everything
is inside the cabinet. It's a giant free for all of wires. There are light wires, the pump power wire and the power cord for the whole system.
It is fortunate that the wires are long enough that things can be moved and adjusted, but it also means that there is a mass of
wires that hang around in there. A harness of some kind to keep these wires in the correct location would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-good"&gt;The good&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-good" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my list of complaints and wish list items out of the way, let's go over what has been good about the garden.
Let's make it clear that, apart from my concern about the number of seeds that didn't grow, the scratches and other
packaging things I mentioned are small and easy enough to ignore. The smudged antenna cleaned up and the scratched top can't be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="craftsmanship"&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#craftsmanship" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of the garden is fantastic. Assembly instructions are clear. At first they appeared to be
long, but after using them during assembly, that's because they are complete. There were no missing steps. The
components fit together well, the hardware needed to assemble the garden was all provided and nothing was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids helped to assemble it, and I believe that's a testament to how easy it is to put together. They knew what to
do and how to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is solid. I am confident it's going to hold the weight of the water and the plants. The biggest thing I need to
worry about is a power outage, which would drain the water (due to gravity) in the basin in the cabinet. If this happens
soon after I refill the water, I suspect it'd overflow. It'll happen at some point, so we'll see how it works out. But,
apart from using a larger basic for a three level garden, I don't think there is anything that needs to change here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="support"&gt;Support&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#support" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've reached out to Rise Gardens support a few times now for various questions I had. I did this both pre-purchase and
post-purchase. In all cases, support has provided me with accurate and helpful answers within a day or two. During the
delivery delays, the company continued to communicate with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they keep this high quality customer support and open communication thing going, they will do well in building
customer loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="it-works"&gt;It works&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#it-works" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise Gardens is a young company. It's been my experience that young companies don't always turn out high quality
productions on their first iteration. Rise Gardens has show that experience is not the rule. Everything worked as
expected when I assembled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pump, the electronics, the assembly instructions. It all just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical hardware of the garden has a few areas where improvement would take a great product to even another
level. The packaging could be improved to reduce some of the cosmetic complaints I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great design. Rise Gardens has clearly put in the time to design something that works as expected,
but is easy to set up, maintain, and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html"&gt;opened the garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;opened the nurseries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;assembled the garden&lt;/a&gt;.
In this post, we plant the first round of seeds, set them in the nursery and wait for them to grow. Let's
continue on this new hydroponic journey with the &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt; indoor garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="planting-pods"&gt;Planting Pods&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#planting-pods" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my post about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;opening the nurseries&lt;/a&gt;, I had pictures of what the seed pods look like. These pods
fit very easily into the pod holders and then slip into the nursery trays. With the variety packs and first
round of seeds we received, it was time to pick what to plant first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first decision we made was that we wouldn't try to grow everything all at once. I can only eat so
much lettuce or so many peppers at a time. I don't want everything ready for harvest all at once. So, we had the kids
fill one nursery while we filled half of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our initial selections were tomatoes, peppers, two types of lettuce, some chamomile, and basil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A full nursery" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/full_nursery.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids filled their nursery. We recorded which plant was which in the Rise Garden app, filled the water level as
appropriate, and set it in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A half full nursery" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/half_full_nursery.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We planted half a nursery's worth of plants, filled the water level, and set it in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="App with plants in the nursery" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/nursery_app.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything planted, we updated the app, and started waiting. Let's see how these grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="three-days-later"&gt;Three days later&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#three-days-later" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Day 3 - Chamomile Sprouts" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/day_3_chamomile.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each morning the kids ran down to the nurseries and looked inside eagerly to see if anything had grown. On day three,
we saw our first sprouts - chamomile. The kids were excited because this was in their nursery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#day-6" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Day 6 - Lettuce, Swiss Chard, Tomatoes, Chamomile" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/day_6.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day six, the kid's nursery had several sprouts. In the image above, you can see a couple lettuces, some swiss chard, the
chamomile, and a small tomato sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Day 6 - Lettuce" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/day_6_2.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult nursery was much less green. We have some lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="transplanting"&gt;Transplanting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#transplanting" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the initial pods were put in to the nurseries, we had sprouts that were touching the roof of the nursery.
I figured it was time to transplant some of the more mature ones. Even though we were a week and a half later, there were
not sprouts in all of the pods. We didn't transplant those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Transplanted Lettuce" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/4_planting/transplanting_2.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we can see the lettuces transplanted to the top layer of the garden. Lettuce doesn't grow tall, so it doesn't
need the extra space provided on the bottom layer. It's also a single harvest, and should grow relatively quickly. We
figured the top level would be great for the faster cycling plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stuck the larger plants - swiss chard, tomatoes and peppers - on the bottom level and left anything else for the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, eleven out of 18 pods were transplanted. The other 7 didn't have sprouts yet. The hope is they will in a few days.
If not, that's a fairly high failure rate and we'll have to figure out something else to plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the first round of plants in the garden, each of us picked one additional pod to plant and added that to the nursery for
the next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've finally made it to the garden. Unfortunately, the next step - harvesting - is a ways off. Even the fastest plants are at least a month
or more away. That's fine though, by the time we can start harvesting, we'll be ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a little concerned about the number of pods that didn't sprout. It is our first attempt though, so maybe it was a
combination of which plants were together and which took in more water. We'll be experimenting with different groupings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids continue to be super interested in this, which is exciting to see. They've grown attached to some of the plants
they've never eaten before, both in the current round of plants and in the plants now in the nursery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next in this series is my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-suggestions-physical.html"&gt;impressions so far&lt;/a&gt;, along with a set of changes that would be nice to make the product even better.
This will cover both the physical hardware and the electronics/automation side too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Assembling the Rise Garden</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-04-26T01:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-26T01:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2020-04-26:/rise-garden-assembly.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Assemble the new Rise Garden&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to assemble the &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt; indoor garden. In previous posts you can find the
process of &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html"&gt;unboxing the garden&lt;/a&gt; and the process of &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;unboxing the nurseries&lt;/a&gt;.
Today, we assemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise Gardens makes the following claim on their web page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within an hour, you can assemble your garden, connect your app, and plant your first herbs and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: If you don't have children helping, you can definitely hit that one hour mark. For me, the kids wanted to help
assemble, so it took about an hour and a half. Not a big deal. It was a good family project and assembly was fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="assembly"&gt;Assembly&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#assembly" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly manual that we pulled out while &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html"&gt;unboxing the garden&lt;/a&gt; is misleading in how complex
the process it. It is a fairly thick manual, but it turns out that is because Rise Gardens has documented the
process very well. Most pieces just fit together, get a couple screws and you keep working your way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lower-shelf-and-level"&gt;Lower Shelf and Level&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#lower-shelf-and-level" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process starts at the base. It's important to note, and it is noted somewhere in the manual, that the
garden needs to be level so that the water flows correctly. If it's not level, water has this weird thing
about not going where you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stuck this in a sun room built on a concrete slab. It's not the most level thing in the area. But, with a
level and some ingenuity we solved that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lower Shelf and Lowest Level" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/lower_brackets.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal shelf sits an inch or two off the ground once the feet have been attached. The screw holes on the bracket
are designed to catch holes built into the shelf. Then they are tightened into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lower Tray" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/lower_tray.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower tray operates on the same principal. The tray catches on, then is screwed into place with the
included allen wrench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upper-levels"&gt;Upper Levels&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#upper-levels" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Middle Brackets" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/middle_tray_brackets.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two levels are installed by adding the extensions for the level. They attach via a screw to
each upright post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Middle Tray" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/middle_tray.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trays are also attached the same way. On the bottom of these trays is the light that will shine down
on the level below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Assembled without trays" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/assembled_no_trays.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the third level is the same as the second. It is topped with the light. If you look closely at the
right foot in this picture, you'll notice we have wedged several layers of cardboard under the foot to
ensure the garden is level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="plumbing"&gt;Plumbing&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#plumbing" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plumbing was as easy to add as the trays. On the lowest level, we added the thick flexible tubes into the basin
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flexible tubes into water basin" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/water_basin_plumbing.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short tube in the back is the pipe that will go up to the plant trays. The longer front one is the water return.
I didn't capture a picture, but the small flexible tubing we unboxed earlier actually will go inside the back tube.
This is different than I envisioned while unboxing it, but frankly makes a lot of sense. This is a thick pipe and I
didn't understand how we wouldn't just flood the system with that much water. The small tubing is much better suited
for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plumbing and plant trays" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/plant_trays.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflexible black pipes fit into the trays. In the picture above, you can see the plumbing pipes on the left
hand side of the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water will flow from the basin at the bottom, all the way to the back top. It will flow around the edge on the right
and drain down to the lower level. This will repeat for the second level and then the first and flow back into the
water basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="testing-the-system"&gt;Testing the system&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#testing-the-system" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With assembly done, it was time to test the lights and add the water to look for leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lights" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/lights.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light check went well. They work at full power and 50% power, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding water to the basin and trays and turning on the pump went better than expected too. Water and I
don't always get along. In this case though, water went up and cycled through as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there was one aspect I didn't like about plant trays and the water. Each level has three
large plant trays with four holes each to support twelve plans on the level. There is also a gap
by the plumbing that has a small black covering too. That covering doesn't fit though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gap between pipe and tray" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/gap.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a gap that forms, because the output pipe on each level prevents this covering
from sitting flat. When the pump was first turned on and for the first few hours, we noticed
that water was splashing out of this gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Outpipe doesn't fit under tray" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/3_assembly/gap_pipe.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see here, the output pipe and it's 90 degree elbow doesn't fit under the black
tray covering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I'll have to keep an eye one. I have had the system running for about
a week, but the time this was posted. The first day or two, while the water level was high,
I noticed this splashing. As the water level got lower though, I noticed less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly was incredibly easy. The kids helped do almost all of it. Plumbing was also easy. Almost,
plug and play, easy. I give huge props to Rise Gardens to making the assembly so simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one big complaint, but it's not related to assembly. It's related to the tray
gap I mentioned above. I really wish the output pipe didn't get in the way of the
black tray coverings, so that it could sit flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have one suggestion. In the next iteration, put adjustable feet on the bottom of the
upright brackets. I can't imagine I'm the only one with an uneven floor, and it'd be so
much easier to level it with some adjustable feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build quality is good, minus that tray fitting. It feels very stable. I've had the water running for a week now
and the plants in the nursery are getting close to the point where they can be transplanted to the
garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-planting.html"&gt;planting the nursery and watching the seeds sprout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Unboxing garden nurseries</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-04-24T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-24T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2020-04-24:/nursery-unboxing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the garden unboxed, it's time to look at the nurseries. Our seed have to start growing somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I opened all of the boxes related to my new indoor, hydroponic
garden from &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. Today's post goes over the opening of the
three nurseries I received. Let's continue my review of the new Rise Gardens farm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html"&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;, that there were shipping delays with the garden. One
of the things that Rise Gardens did to make up for this was ship additional nurseries,
nutrients and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurseries showed up a week before the garden did. Had I been planning properly, I would have
set them up at that time. That way when the garden arrived I'd be a week into waiting for my
sprouts. Alas, I did not, so the garden was assembled the same day the nurseries were started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. On to the unboxing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-unboxing"&gt;The Unboxing&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-unboxing" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Boxes of nurseries" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/nurseries_boxed.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurseries showed up in three boxes, all taped together. This should have been my first indication
that the company loves tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Inside of the boxes" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/box_1_seeds_instructions.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxes two and three had identical contents. Box one had a couple extras. The first extra
was this nice quick start guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quick Start - Inside" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/inside_instructions.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It very quickly covers what's in the three boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrient Sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batteries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plant Holders (12 for the nursery, plus 6 extra for the next round of plants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seed packs. It says 4, but boxes two and three actually had five seed packs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives you a quick overview of how to use the nursery. It's pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the cover off a seed pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't dump out the seed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place it in the nursery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put in the appropriate amount of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quick Start - Back" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/back_instructions.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step in the quick start is a note on the application provide by Rise Gardens.
I'm new at hydroponics, so I'm looking forward to using this for the first few growing
cycles. I'm also hoping that I learn something about how much nutrient solution I should
be adding, so that I don't need to be reliant on the app in the future. We'll see
how that works out. Technology is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nursery" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/nursery.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the nursery! I'm going to admit, I was surprised by how small this nursery is.
I don't know what I was expecting, but it was larger. Now that I've thought about it for
more than five seconds though, this is perfect. This is a &lt;em&gt;nursery&lt;/em&gt;. It's designed to
help the plants sprout, not grow. That's what the garden is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nursery holds twelve plant pods and has a hole for adding water. If you look closely at the
inside of the quick start guide, you'll see the nice bold warning: Never add nutrients to nursery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plant Pod" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/plant_holder.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant pods, or net cups as the quick start calls them, clips into the nursery. They are
easy to add and remove. They are also much more solidly built than the plastic of the
nursery. I'm interested in seeing how the nursery holds up after a couple cycles of
clipping/unclipping these pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nutrient Sensor" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/water_tester.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing in the first box, apart from the seeds, is the nutrient sensor and
extra batteries. Before I migrate plants from the nursery to the garden, I'll read
up on how this works. In the mean time, quickly looking at it I see that it does
pH readings and EC (electro-current) readings. As I go through a few cycles, and with
the help of the app, I'll figure out what is the correct range of values for each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nutrients" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/nutrients.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In boxes two and three, there were nutrients for the garden. It's not mentioned
in the quick start, but in the large instruction manual provided with the garden itself,
there are brief instructions on the difference between the two provided here. The
general idea, though, is that it helps the plants grow and produce. Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-seeds"&gt;The seeds&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-seeds" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the seeds. What will I be growing on the first round of two of plants.
With a three tier garden, and three nurseries, I have room for 36 individual. That's a
lot of vegetables all at once. I'm planning on staggering these in 3-4 week batches. That
what I don't get 40 tomatoes all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the boxes, I received the same plants for each, plus an extra box of chamomile in
boxes two and three. That's eight pods. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that
much chamomile, but I'll figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="salad-mix"&gt;Salad Mix&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#salad-mix" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Salad Mix" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/salad_mix.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each large box, I received two salad mix boxes. Each of these contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of Red Oak lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of butter lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of dragoon romain lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of astro arugula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have lettuce forever. Excellent. These also grow relatively quickly, so I'll
be able to cycle through these consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="variety-pack"&gt;Variety Pack&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#variety-pack" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Variety Pack" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/variety_pack.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a variety pack in each large box. This pack contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of little bing tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of dwarf blue kale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of swiss chard bright lights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pod of fresh bites orange peppers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="basil"&gt;Basil&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#basil" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Basil" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/basil.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last package of seeds was four pods of basil, in each large package. I'm not sure
what I'm going to do with twelve basil pods, but again, I'll figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="plant-pod"&gt;Plant Pod&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#plant-pod" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plant Pod" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/2_unboxing/plant_pod.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant seed pods fit nicely into the net cups. There are a couple seeds in
each pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurseries look easy enough to use. Select the plants I want, stick the seed pods
into a net cup and add water. Wait a week or two for sprouts and then transfer to the
garden until harvest time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint about this entire round of unboxing is rather minor. Honestly, it
wouldn't even be a complaint, if I hadn't received the variety packs of seeds. If, instead
I'd gotten just single pods of lettuce or tomato or peppers, I wouldn't have thought
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My complaint is that I have twelve pods of basil. I don't use that much basil. A variety
pack of herbs would have been awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as I said, very minor complaint. I will figure out what to do with some fresh basil.
I have family members that will probably be happy to get some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the nurseries look good. The seeds look good. The tiny little gardener in
me is ready to see if I can grow something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With another unboxing complete, I am ready to start assembling the garden. My next post
will cover &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-assembly.html"&gt;assembly of the garden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Unboxing and reviewing the new indoor Rise Gardens hydroponic garden</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-gardens-unboxing.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-04-22T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2020-04-22:/rise-gardens-unboxing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The garden has arrived!

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next several posts, I'm going to provide my review of the family's new
indoor garden. At the point this article is being written, it's been unboxed, assembled
and we've planted the first round of seeds. I anticipate by the time I'm done with this series,
I'll have some plants migrated from the nursery to the garden itself. Once I reach the point of
harvest, I'll provide a follow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, let's begin my review of the new Rise Gardens farm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: For the final summary, please read my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-final-review.html"&gt;final review&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read
the whole series because I cover individual aspects of the product, but if you are just looking for the
final review, you can jump right to that &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/rise-garden-final-review.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of last year, I had my mind set that I wanted a small indoor garden. We used to have
an outdoor garden, but it never really did that well. This was due to both the soil and the wildlife.
Last summer and fall, I went and forth between building an internal garden and buying one and
never really settled on one. During the winter, I found &lt;a href="https://risegardens.com/"&gt;Rise Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hydroponic garden, which is exactly what I wanted. I don't want soil everywhere
and I'd prefer something self contained. Plus, I was secretly hoping the kids would find it
exciting to watch vegetables grow and then harvest and eat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the entire world shut down due to COVID-19, I ordered a garden. It was scheduled to ship in
mid-February. Sadly, it did not. The shipping date arrived and an email notice was sent saying that shipping
had been delayed approximately a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-March showed up and again, no garden. This time, though, I was promised additional nurseries and some
plant nutrients for waiting patiently. I had no major complaints and with the world slowly isolating
itself, we were figuring out what was going on. The delay was not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came mid-April. Another email and another shipping delay. However, the nurseries, seeds and nutrients
would ship on time with the garden being delayed a week. As the email said, the nurseries showed
and a week later so did the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delays were unfortunate. But, I really have no major complaints. Rise Gardens was very communicative
about the delays and the causes. A global pandemic will screw with your supply chain and logistics capabilities.
Plus, the nurseries were nice. I'll cover those in a later article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the level of communication that I've seen so far. I hope that continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-unboxing"&gt;The Unboxing&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-unboxing" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="boxes"&gt;Boxes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#boxes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ordered the triple level garden. According to the specifications, that means it's 66 inches tall and weights 106 pounds.
It showed up in three boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Garden Boxes" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/garden_boxes.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two boxes on the left are the second and third levels of the garden. The big box is the main garden, the water basin,
and the electronic brains of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="extensions"&gt;Extensions&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#extensions" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by opening the smaller boxes. Each extension comes with a planter tray, a grow light for the level below, some
tray covers for the plants, wooden extensions to add to the main garden, and some assembly hardware (screws).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Extension 1" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/tray_covers_extension_tidy.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this picture, the tray the water will sit in is the black tray. If you look closely, you see that it is in a white tray.
This is the light cover for the lower level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Extension 2" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/tray_covers_extension_untidy.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second extension has the same hardware as the first. The difference is, this one didn't show up as nicely packaged. It
looks like tape holdig the tray covers in place came loose in shipping and allowed everything to slide around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Extension Brackets" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/extension_brackets.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These brackets are nice. They have a spot to hide the wire used to plug in the lights, seem solidly made and (spoiler)
fit together correctly when assembling the levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Grow Lights" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/level_lights.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each level of the garden has a set of grow lights. These are two LED panels. The light tray also holds the plastic
water tray of the level above. The two holes you see at the top of this light panel are wher the plumbing passes through
to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="main-garden"&gt;Main Garden&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#main-garden" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Big Garden Box" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/garden_box_open.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large garden box contains three big items inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first item is the metal shelving unit. When assembled, this shelf will hold the water basin inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Garden Shelf" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/bottom_shelf_water_tray.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shelf has two doors. On the outside are five LED lights which are used to indicate the water level
of the basic. There is also a button that controls the LED lights. This button cycles through full intensity, half
intensity and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Water Basin" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/water_tray.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marks on the water basic coorespond to the lights on the exterior of the shelving unit. There are five blue
water level marks and five LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Water Pump" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/water_pump.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucked inside the water basin is the water pump. This hangs from the side of the basic and is submerged into the
water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Watering Can" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/watering_can.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise Gardens provides a watering can. This is useful for filling the trays as well as the basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Antenna" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/antenna_smudged.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the side of the shelf unit is a spot to screw in the little antenna. This allows the control board to
connect to the local wireless network. In doing so, you can connect your phone to the garden and receive
updates about water levels as well as help in planning out your garden and when nutrients should be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My antenna showed up looking rather smudged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Control Board" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/control_board.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control board is already set up and attached to the internal side of the shelf unit. I am not sure what the
A and B ports are used for and don't recall reading about them in the manual, but the rest of the ports are
pretty easy to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Main Garden Tray" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/tray.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the extensions mentioned above, the main garden comes with the first tray of the system. Also like
one of the extensions mentioned above, the internal parts of this tray came loose and shifted during
transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Loose Screws" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/tray_hardware_untidy.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly hardware and brick portion of the power supply slide all over. Some of the screws got wedged between the
tray and the cardboard packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this also seems to have scratched the tray a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Top Lights" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/garden/1_unboxing/top_light_brackets.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the packaging is the top light and brackets. The brackets here re the legs that attach to
the shelf and hold it off the ground. The light will be installed above the top level of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll provide a more concise break down of pros and cons in a later article, so that you don't need to read each
individual one. For now though, let's talk about what I thought while unboxing everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed was that Rise Gardens provides printed instructions. This is something I'd been worried about.
I had found their &lt;a href="https://support.risegardens.com/en_us/garden-assembly-and-setup-instructions-SJBeSfy9c"&gt;assembly instructions&lt;/a&gt; on their web site and I was concerned that's what I've had to use to assemble
the garden. The included instructors are the same as those on the website, but I like the tangible instructions to needing
my phone near by during assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing I noticed, both during this unboxing and while unboxing the nurseries is that Rise Gardens loves their packaging
tape. Box seams are fully covered. Tape is not something they are concerned about...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...on the outside boxes. Internally though, the lack of tape or using cheap masking tape, caused interal components to break free
and slide all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware feels very high quality. I don't feel like I'm going to snap these wooden legs or brackets when I put weight on them. The
control board, and the electronics in general, appear very well assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, despite some packaging annoyances, I'm looking forward to assembling this thing over the coming day. Next up, though, is
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/nursery-unboxing.html"&gt;unpacking my first round of seeds and the nurseries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"/><category term="review"/><category term="garden"/><category term="hydroponics"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2019 course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/aws-certified-developer-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-12-23T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-12-23T10:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2019-12-23:/aws-certified-developer-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate course.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my personal and professional goals for 2019 was to get a certification of some kind. That's a
fairly broad requirement with no real reasoning behind it. I wanted to learn something and I wanted it
to be helpful at work. As the year rapidly entered the last few months, I realized I not done anything
to reach the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief talk with my management, it was decided that I should get an AWS certification. It'd help
the company out with some work we are doing to become an AWS partner, and I'd get a certification that would
be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a read goal, I set out to learn something. I started by finding &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/"&gt;Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2019&lt;/a&gt;
on Udemy. At the time I'm posting this entry, the course has been updated to be useful for 2020. It's always a good sign
that the creator is continuously updating their materials. This course was created by Stephane Maarek, who also
holds the certification that is being taught about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course-overview"&gt;Course Overview&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is a 19 hour overview of most of AWS. At first I thought that length was excessive, but it turns out
that 19 hours isn't enough. This course is focused only on the AWS products that you need to know for the DVA-C01
certification. There is...a lot to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materials go through how to use AWS's free tier for almost all of the work needed for the course. The very few
areas that can't utilize the free tier are explicitly called out, so you don't end up with surprise AWS bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend you set aside the time to go through this course and the practice tests. Then, I recommend
that you do it again. AWS has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of services with three letter names. You need to know how those work
and interact with one another. You need to know how to troubleshoot them, set them up, and scale them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pass through this course wasn't enough for me. I don't blame the instructor though. I blame the expansiveness of
the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice questions were very similar to what questions looked like on the real exam. The concepts that were
covered were helpful in answering a few others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (when?) I go for the next level of certifications in Amazon, I'll be looking for more courses from this creator.
The course is very well built, very hands on, and obviously updated to stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, I took my exam and passed on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other professional goals for next year, but if I decide to go for another AWS certification, I'll
be looking for another course by Stephane Maarek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a year and a half since I set up GitLab. In that time I've used to it
store my personal code, keep track of features I want to add to my own projects,
and generally loved it. One thing I haven't done though, is play with the CI/CD
features. I've been wanting to, but never got around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize the CI/CD features, you need to set up a &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/"&gt;GitLab runner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-up"&gt;Set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="docker"&gt;Docker&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#docker" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be running my runners in &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; containers. There are other options,
but for my home environment, this is easiest to set up and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start by installing Docker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;certificates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;software&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fsSL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ubuntu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to add the Docker repository and install the community edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gitlab-runner"&gt;GitLab Runner&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gitlab-runner" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Docker is installed and working, we can install the GitLab runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;downloads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amazonaws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binaries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amd64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;chmod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;useradd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'GitLab Runner'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;working&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is downloading the install package. Then it adds a new user, that the runner will run as. This is a nice security precaution to limit what the runner has access to on the system. It's not full security, but it does all me to restrict what that particular user has access to on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the run is started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the runner needs to be registered. Log into GitLab, and navigate to
the project that will be using this runner. It should be available at this link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://url.to.your.gitlab.install/&amp;lt;account&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;repo&amp;gt;/settings/ci_cd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the GitLab CI token. That is needed in the next step. Run the &lt;code&gt;gitlab-runner register&lt;/code&gt; command, and fill in your values as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ci&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coordinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;registered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;running&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;already&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;automatically&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reloaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with Docker is limited, so I am using the latest alpine version. I'm sure there are better ones to use for a simple Python application, but this works for me and I'm not concerned about the absolute fastest CI/CD pipeline on my server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="using-the-cicd-pipeline"&gt;Using the CI/CD pipeline&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-cicd-pipeline" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the GitLab runner is registered to a single project and is ready to use. You can enable your project to use this pipeline by adding a &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to the root of your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used it to set up the following pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Python - GitLab Pipeline" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/gitlab-python-pipeline.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pipeline has 4 stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="static-analysis"&gt;Static Analysis&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#static-analysis" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Static Analysis phase, I run various analysis tools over my code. The goal here is to ensure that my code, YAML documents, and documentation are easy to read and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice the the xenon task has a warning in the image. I have the settings pretty strict in this pipeline, where I allow a very low &lt;a href="https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#cyclomatic-complexity"&gt;Cyclomatic Complexity&lt;/a&gt;. In this project, I have one function that is just barely failing my strict settings. I have allowed the pipeline to continue if this one particular task fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could either increase the allowed complexity in the code base to ignore the warning. Alternatively, I could not allow the pipeline to proceed until I fix this function. This was one of those instances where it hasn't been worth it to refactor the code, but I want to be reminded I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; fix it, so I allow the pipeline to proceed and show me the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="test"&gt;Test&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#test" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Test phase should be fairly self explanatory. It's the stage where I run my test suite. It will only run if the Static Analysis phase completes successfully (or I allow a specific job to fail, in the case of the xenon task).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="deploy-testing"&gt;Deploy Testing&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#deploy-testing" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the test suite has completed successfully, I deploy the package to the test instance of PyPI. This ensures that I have a successful build and deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="deploy-production"&gt;Deploy Production&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#deploy-production" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment to production is a manual step. I did this because I don't always want to push changes to production PyPI. This is especially true if I'm only making small fixes - such as white space changes. I don't want to skip the entire CI process, but I also don't want to push out to production for something so minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="environment-set-up"&gt;Environment set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#environment-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest complaints about the Travis CI integration with GitHub is how you &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html"&gt;can't trust environment variables in Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;. Since I control the server that this runner is connected to, I have no problem adding environment variables into GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the project, I was able to add these by going to Settings-&amp;gt;CI/CD and expanding the Variables section. I needed to store credentials for both the test and production instances of PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GitLab Environment Variables" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/gitlab-env-variables.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these added, they are now accessible by my &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gitlab-ciyml"&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gitlab-ciyml" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script I use to build the pipeline is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"python:3.7"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id="gitlab-ciyml-explanation"&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml explanation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#gitlab-ciyml-explanation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few areas that I feel need to be explained in the script above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tags"&gt;Tags&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#tags" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;.python-tag:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;tags:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is a template that is used to add the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; tag to a job step. The Runner will only run tasks that have a tag you assigned to it. This is useful if you are building across multiple operating systems or across multiple languages. You don't want a runner set up to test against a Windows environment picking up tasks for a Linux environment. In my case, everything is being run for a single runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each step, I need to add this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;extends:
  - .python-tag
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; tag will be automatically applied to the task. For a simple pipeline like mine, it may seem like overkill, but it's useful if I want to force other tags or steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="allow-failures"&gt;Allow failures&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#allow-failures" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xenon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Analysis&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xenon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;average&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously mentioned that I allowed the xenon step to fail. This is accomplished with the &lt;code&gt;allow_failue: true&lt;/code&gt; setting you see here. Since this setting is in place, the pipeline will proceed even if this single task fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="manual-deployment"&gt;Manual deployment&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#manual-deployment" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy_production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Production&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;manual&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TWINE_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PYPI_PROD_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TWINE_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PYPI_PROD_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdist&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;twine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deploy to production is a manual step. I use &lt;code&gt;when: manual&lt;/code&gt; to ensure this step doesn't occur automatically. At some point in the future, this project will be stable and won't have minor fixes any longer and I'll want to automatically deploy to production without interaction. When I reach that point, I'll just need to remove this line. As long as the preceding steps succeed, this one will be performed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've set this up and come to rely on it, I think my next steps will be converting my home Minecraft Server to use the GitLab pipelines to automatically deploy updates. Look for that post in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="gitlab"/></entry><entry><title>Installing InvoiceNinja on Ubuntu 18.04</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/invoiceninja-ubuntu-1804.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-07-30T13:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-30T13:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2019-07-30:/invoiceninja-ubuntu-1804.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief walkthrough on how to install InvoiceNinja on Ubuntu 18.04&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a several years since I really did a lot of freelance work. Mostly, I did it in the evening hours
a few nights a week for some extra money. Over the last few years, that kind of work has
slowed down for me. Mostly because I enjoy relaxing in the evenings and spending time off
of my computer now. It's weird to type that, but "hobby coding" really hasn't had as much
appeal to me since I started my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-found-an-awesome-remote-only-job.html"&gt;current job&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my job. I love working from home 100% of the time and I love being home
when the kids get off the bus, during summer breaks, and when the weather sucks. The
one thing this job has done though, is remove my desire to sit in my office after
everyone else has gone to bed and just code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that's ok. I've found other hobbies and am really excited about some up coming
things I'm trying out. If they work out, I'll be able to combine my coding skills
with other hobbies. I'm sure I'll write about it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say all of that, because, even though I don't actively take on freelance work any
longer, I still have clients that I did work for that will reach out once and a while
for help, consultations or a small project. When that happens, I need a way to bill them
for my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, my invoices would have been whipped up in Word and converted to a PDF and sent
off to the client. It worked for years. I was able to keep track of everything,
properly report it (don't want to mess with the tax man) and I kept chugging along. The
problem now, is that if I'm doing work for a client, I want to do the work and be done. I don't
want to spent time making a presentable invoice in Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I went hunting for some software. I found &lt;a href="https://www.invoiceninja.com/"&gt;InvoiceNinja&lt;/a&gt;. It's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted or self hosted version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create simple invoices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create full quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API (which I will probably never use, but...it's there)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recurring billing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zapier integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this habit of self hosting my own software. See my posts on &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-nextcloud.html"&gt;NextCloud&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; for other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rest of this post is going to walk through how I installed InvoiceNinja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting Started&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be self hosting &lt;a href="https://www.invoiceninja.org/"&gt;InvoiceNinja&lt;/a&gt;. You can find that on their &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; site
or on &lt;a href="https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this, I'll be installing InvoiceNinja, setting up Apache to host it, and showing how
to update it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;invoiceninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unzip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This downloads and unzips InvoiceNinja 4.5.14 to the current directory. Next,
let's move it to it's final install location and set up appropriate owner and
permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;mv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ninja&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/www/html
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/www/html
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;chown&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;www-data:www-data&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ninja/
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;chmod&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;755&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ninja/storage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="database-setup"&gt;Database setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#database-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InvoiceNinja runs on MySQL (or MariaDB). We need to create the database, but
the installer will do the rest of the work for us. Log into MySQL with a user
that can create new databases, users and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;mysql&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-u&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;root&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-p
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we'll run three commands. The first is to create the new database, the second
is to create the user. The third is to set appropriate permissions for the
new user and new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition attention"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the default password from &lt;code&gt;ninja&lt;/code&gt; to something secure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our three commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE ninja;
CREATE USER 'ninja'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ninja';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ninja.* TO 'ninja'@'localhost';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="configure-apache"&gt;Configure Apache&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#configure-apache" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're going to set up a new virtualhost in Apache to serve InvoiceNinja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an entry in sites-available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/invoiceninja.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My entry looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;*:80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;DocumentRoot&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/www/html/ninja/public
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;ServerName&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;invoice.example.com
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;Redirect&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;permanent&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://invoice.example.com/

&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/var/www/html/ninja/public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Options&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;+FollowSymlinks
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;AllowOverride&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;All
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Require&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;granted
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;*:443&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ServerName&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;invoice.example.com
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;DocumentRoot&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/www/html/ninja/public
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;SSLEngine&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;on
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;SSLCertificateFile&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/path/to/dehydrated/certs/invoice.example.com/cert.pem
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;SSLCertificateKeyFile&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/path/to/dehydrated/certs/invoice.example.com/privkey.pem
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;SSLCertificateChainFile&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/path/to/dehydrated/certs/invoice.example.com/chain.pem
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;IfModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;mod_headers.c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Header&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;always&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;set&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Strict-Transport-Security&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;"max-age=15552000;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;includeSubDomains"
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/var/www/html/ninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Options&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;FollowSymLinks
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;AllowOverride&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;All
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Order&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;allow,deny
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;allow&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;all
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sets up a direct from HTTP to HTTPS. Then it points to the SSL certificates I've
created for this subdomain. I previously wrote about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/setup-lets-encrypt.html"&gt;how I set up SSL&lt;/a&gt;. I followed the
same steps, using the new subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SSL and the subdomain set up in CloudFlare, it's time to enable the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a2ensite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;invoiceninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;systemctl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="completing-the-install"&gt;Completing the install&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#completing-the-install" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the new subdomain, and fill out the form. Installation will be
completed in a minute or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, InvoiceNinja will come out with an update, and I'll want to update
to get the newest features and security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, we want to download the newest version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;invoiceninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unzip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ninja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; the files to the installed directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;rsync&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-tr&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ninja/&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/www/html/ninja/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This messes up permissions, so reset those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/www/html
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;chown&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;www-data:www-data&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ninja/
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;chmod&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;755&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ninja/storage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, hit the &lt;code&gt;/update&lt;/code&gt; URL to complete the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget https://invoice.example.com/update

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/new-house-server.html"&gt;new server&lt;/a&gt; has been up and running for about a year and a half now. It's still
working really well. The thing that I'm happiest with is &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-nextcloud.html"&gt;my NextCloud install&lt;/a&gt;. Having
my pictures automatically backed up from the phones is a huge time saver. I no
longer need to worry about whether or not I grabbed a set of pictures off the
phone or which phone has which picture. It's all in one place in NextCloud. This
makes it easy to find what I'm looking for (and easy to backup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextCloud runs on PHP, which means I need to have PHP installed on the server
for it to work. This isn't a huge problem, but the last time I really used PHP,
it was during the transition between PHP 4 and PHP 5. So...a while ago. I set up PHP
(and Apache) to host NextCloud and really just forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent update of packages on the server - because I do like to keep
everything updated. I noticed this line during the &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; scroll:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;php7.1 module already enabled, not enabling PHP 7.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to figure out how to use that newly install/upgraded PHP 7.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-actually-running"&gt;What is actually running?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-actually-running" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was check which version of PHP was being used in the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;php&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-v
PHP&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;.3.7-2+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cli&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;built:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Jul&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;:44:59&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;NTS&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
Copyright&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1997&lt;/span&gt;-2018&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;PHP&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Group
Zend&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Engine&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;v3.3.7,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Copyright&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1998&lt;/span&gt;-2018&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Zend&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Technologies
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;with&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Zend&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;OPcache&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;v7.3.7-2+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Copyright&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1999&lt;/span&gt;-2018,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;by&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Zend&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Technologies
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's promising. The default version here is PHP 7.3.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, throwing a quick &lt;code&gt;phpinfo();&lt;/code&gt; together and looking at what it running via
Apache, shows something different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;PHP Version 7.1.30-1+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Now I know which module is out of date. It's the run that is configured to
be used with Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="verifying-whats-installed"&gt;Verifying what's installed&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#verifying-whats-installed" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assumed I had PHP 7.3 installed, but I wanted to confirm before I just started
disabling and enabling Apache modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm I had PHP 7.3 available, I ran this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a quick check to see what's enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent. I have PHP 7.3 available, and PHP 7.1 is enabled. This is exactly what
I'm seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="updating-apache-php-module"&gt;Updating Apache PHP Module&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updating-apache-php-module" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With PHP 7.3 already installed, I just need to disable PHP 7.1 and enable PHP 7.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a2dismod&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;php7.1
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a2enmod&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;php7.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then restart Apache to use the new module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;service&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apache2&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, validate the correct module is enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another check of the &lt;code&gt;phpinfo();&lt;/code&gt; page too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;PHP Version 7.3.7-2+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matches what &lt;code&gt;php -v&lt;/code&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're done! Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="checking-nextcloud"&gt;Checking NextCloud&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#checking-nextcloud" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With PHP updated, it was time to make sure the one PHP application I run still
worked. I visited my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/setup-lets-encrypt.html"&gt;NextCloud URL I set up CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;. There I was greeted
with a blank page. Oddly, I couldn't find any errors in my server logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;a2dismod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a2enmod&lt;/code&gt; commands from above, I downgraded back to
PHP 7.1. NextCloud worked. I upgraded to PHP 7.2 and it worked. Going back to PHP
7.3, and I was back to a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without server logs, this indicated that either NextCloud doesn't support
PHP 7.3 or I was missing modules. A check of the &lt;a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/15/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html"&gt;system requirements for NextCloud&lt;/a&gt;
shows that PHP 7.3 is supported. That just means I'm missing some modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation also includes a &lt;a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/15/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation"&gt;list of all needed modules&lt;/a&gt; and a nice
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh/"&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; for easy installation. Looking through that, I found the &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/c469b3045c7405261a0d9f20fec7ef5f0f508efe/nextcloud_install_production.sh#L256-L272"&gt;packages I needed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;php7.3-fpm&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-intl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-ldap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-imap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-gd&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-pgsql&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-xml&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-zip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-mbstring&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-soap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-smbclient&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-json&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-gmp&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
php7.3-bz2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minute or so later, with those modules now installed, I restarted Apache again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;service&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apache2&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went to my NextCloud URL. The page loaded as expected and my phone
sync'd the one picture I took as a test to ensure it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a really simple process. The biggest issue I ran into was missing
a module or two that NextCloud required. Simply installing everything it needed
worked perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Travis CI Tutorial Udemy course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/travis-ci-tutorial-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-07-09T14:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-09T14:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2019-07-09:/travis-ci-tutorial-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Travis CI Tutorial course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: This course is no longer accepting enrollments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about Travis CI before. I've reported a bug that makes it fairly easy
to see &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html"&gt;environment variables in Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; or even unintentionally transfer
them if you transfer your repository. I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/autobuild-pelican-blog.html"&gt;build this blog using Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;. I've
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-openshift-travisci-and-flask.html"&gt;used Travis CI to set up an OpenShift application&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; uses it to
manage it's blacklists. In short, I have experience with Travis CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised when I saw a course being offered for free recently on Udemy that
deals with Travis CI. Since it was free and only a couple hours long, I figured I'd
give it a shot. I enrolled in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my review of &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/travis-ci-tutorial/"&gt;Travis CI Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by Vaga Notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course starts with no instructor introduction, no explanation of what
the course is about, or goals for the course. If you don't know what Travis CI is,
don't expect to learn that here. You are expected to know what it is and what
it does. Honestly, you should probably have used it before too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All coding done for this course is gone in the GitHub web editor. This bothered
me initially, but after thinking about it, not so much. Most of the "real code"
needed for this course is simply editing the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file and the instructor
saves a lot of time by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; dealing with git and GitHub more than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I think that is going to be the last good thing I have to say
about this course. The rest can be summed up with one word: Inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound is inconsistent. From one lesson to another, the instructor goes from
being whisper quiet at highest volume to so loud it hurts. The microphone being
used picks up static and most annoyingly, the instructor keeps coughing into the
mic. Sound &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a lesson is also inconsistent. In one lesson - Lesson 13 "Build Stages" -
it went from quiet to loud and back multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing of the course material was inconsistent. The instructor recording their
videos an hour after they had done it the first time, in some cases. This
short time between doing it the first time and recording it for the tutorial
is seen in how the instructor handles unexpected delays and failing builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is inconsistent. On several videos, the instructor obviously
spent time making an intro and outro for the lecture. It's a few second animation
and sound effect that encapsulates the lesson. On others, they jump right into the
material or awkwardly end the lesson. If the instructor had spent more time
giving the course a unified look and feel through the entire course, it'd come
across as more polished. Instead, it looks like it was thrown together haphazardly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the content. This is also inconsistent. There are points where
the instructor didn't have a script at worse and only high level bullet points
at best. They mumble their way through an explanation or series of interface
options. They live code - with typos - their way through set up. They navigate to
GitHub using Google Search, but accidentally click to quickly and get a previous
search result (that could have been embarrassing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the live coded examples and an after thought of an explanation of
what each step means, there is very bad advice given in some locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example of this is setting up environment variables (see my post
on &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html"&gt;Travis CI environment variables&lt;/a&gt;). While setting up the GitHub token, so
that Travis can deploy GitHub Pages, the advice given is to "just give it all
the access". NO! NO NO NO NO NO! NO!. Especially when combined with the next
step they took, which isn't even described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor moves over to Travis CI from GitHub to put in the environment variable.
They put in the name of the variable and the value. Then they change the "Display
this value in build log" from the default "Off" to "On" &lt;em&gt;and don't say why&lt;/em&gt;!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later a build is pushed, the Travis CI log is shown, and there is the
GitHub token that had "all the access" displayed in the build log. Anyone can
come along and use that token to do anything to your GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is now listed for $20. It's not worth it. Go find something on YouTube,
look at another repository that is already using Travis CI or Google for an example.
Any of those options are going to be more useful to you - and more consistent - than
this course. With the bad sound, half finished video introductions, and horrible
advice on token generation the only thing you'll be doing if you take this course is
play with your volume constantly and learn the wrong way to set up environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course feels like it was recorded while the instructor was home sick with a
minor cold and got bored with their video editing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do QA work for my job and love learning new things, techniques or ways of doing
my job better. The &lt;a href="https://ude.my/UC-1F1K67C9"&gt;Software Testing Masterclass (2019) - From Novice to Expert&lt;/a&gt;
caught my eye during one of Udemy's many sales. This course is only five hours long
so I figured it'd be a quick overview (and I'd be able to skip of the 'novice') part
of the course. It was created by Ozan Ä°lhan. Their Udemy biograph says they
have been a professional software tester for the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, English is not the instructor's first language. In most of the
course this is not a problem, but be aware that there are some grammatical things
that may throw a native speaker. Normally, I wouldn't count this against the
instructor, but they specifically call out in the course description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All videos have hand edited subtitles. We spent many hours to correct all the subtitles to help you to have a smooth learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, those subtitles are exactly what was said, so the grammar issues
are even more glaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "high-quality sound" that boasted about in the course description doesn't
seem accurate. Sound from one lesson to the next varies wildly. In one lesson
it is difficult to hear the instructor and in the next they are super loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, on to the actual content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt this course did not take the "to Expert" part of the name to heart. Much
of the content was power point slides being read to the student. The "Novice"
portion of the course was laying a groundwork for students to understand the
different types of testing, software development life cycle, how to report bugs,
and how to build test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor provided a template for bug reporting and test case checklists. I
cringe a little bit because these are Excel documents, but I've worked in the
corporate world and Excel is the hammer used to pound every nail. I've seen and used
templates that look very similar. It's not flashy or "an app", but it is what's
used "in the real world", even if I hated using it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the "Expert" part of the course is labeled "Advance Testing Concepts",
which covers different types of tests in more detail. This covers, black box testing,
smoke and sanity testing, reggression testing, risk based testing and a few others.
Unfortunately, this is presented as Power Point slides again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last real content in the course is covering how to sign up for various
things like GitHub, JIRA, TestRail and TestLodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the course ends with what feels like a bunch of advertisements for
freelance testing services. There are very brief overviews of uTest, Testlio,
and BugFinders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am disappointed in this course. I was really hoping the "Expert" part
covered a bit more or even new methods. Unfortunately, everything here I've heard
of and used at one point or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I'm really disappointed that so much of the course was being read
a Power Point presentation. I was hoping to see some testing frameworks in action
to compare/contrast the benefits of one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the over use of Power Point though, and the last part of the course feeling
like plugs for various services, I can't recommend this course.&lt;/p&gt;

How's Stack Overflow doing (from the perspective of a long time community member and moderator)?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="last-time-on-this-blog"&gt;Last time on this blog&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#last-time-on-this-blog" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a year and a half ago, I wrote an article about &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stack-overflows-problem-feedback-from-an-experienced-user.html"&gt;Stack Overflow's problems&lt;/a&gt;
from my perspective as an experienced user. This was before I was &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/collecting-diamonds-on-stack-exchange.html"&gt;elected as a moderator&lt;/a&gt; on
Stack Overflow. I ended the previous article with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to invest my time and effort into the community, but even as an active user who
really wants the company and community to succeed, it's getting harder and harder to ignore that
those of us that have been around for years are not being listened to any more. We're being treated as the
grumpy old person that grumbles about the way things used to be. Our experiences on the site are brushed aside as
being unhelpful to new users. That completely ignores that fact that we are still trying to reach
the goal on which Stack Overflow was created:
&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour"&gt;"With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed answers to every question about programming."&lt;/a&gt;
To do this, we need high quality questions and answers so that we can actually provide help to all users. I
think &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the biggest challenge that Stack Overflow is going to face in the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's happened in the last 18 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of development (being announced in 2015), &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/354217/189134"&gt;Documentation was shuttered&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2017. Stack Overflow
wasn't drawing users to the Documentation feature. Their own metrics and analysis showed that fixing Documentation to
be useful to users - both new and experienced - would require a significantly larger team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-went-wrong"&gt;What went wrong?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-went-wrong" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, and as I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stack-overflows-problem-feedback-from-an-experienced-user.html"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, Stack Overflow has ignored it's user base. This is going to be a recurring
theme in this post. For years, users provided feedback on meta, in dedicated user experience interviews and in chatrooms.
This resulted in superficial changes and major rewrites. Yet, complaints still existed. These complaints turned off the
experienced users that could produce the high quality documentation. Instead, Documentation became a reputation farming operation
in all but name. This turned off even more users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Stack Overflow's own admission when sun setting the feature, Documentation was built to solve a problem that wasn't really a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our research showed that while a lot of developers were dissatisfied, the current state of programming documentation is
not universally broken the way Q&amp;amp;A was when Stack Overflow started. In particular, we heard over and over that Stack Overflow
has become de facto documentation for many technologies. As many of you pointed out, Stack Overflow is already good enough
at providing documentation of obscure features. Even when considering just the company's mission of helping programmers
âlearn, share their knowledge and build their careersâ, Documentation isn't the most efficient use of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years of major development, focusing on a problem that the community had not been enthusiastic about, and intentionally ignoring
other feature requests and other improvements angered a lot of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="teams"&gt;Teams&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#teams" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stack-overflows-problem-feedback-from-an-experienced-user.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that Teams had been launched and shut down in less than a year. Teams is back! At least the name is.
Initially launched as &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/352065/189134"&gt;"Channels"&lt;/a&gt;, and later re-branded to "Stack Overflow for Teams", this is a money generating route for Stack Overflow.
It uses the &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"&gt;old URL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, generating money is good. It's good for both the community and the company. Without money, the company can't survive. Without the
company there is not Stack Overflow or community. My problem isn't with money generation. My problem is that, once again, community feature
requests for higher quality and moderation tooling to cultivate that higher quality was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all accounts, Teams seems to be doing well and bringing in revenue. I am hopeful that this translates into development time to
build out the features the community still clamors for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meta-hatred"&gt;Meta hatred&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#meta-hatred" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta. &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/meta-is-murder/"&gt;It's murder.&lt;/a&gt; Until it's not. Meta is how Stack Overflow communicates with the community. It's how the community
communicates with itself. It's where governing principals/thoughts/guidance/sticky notes comes from. In short, meta is a
large part of how Stack Overflow the company and Stack Overflow the community talks with one another. Decisions are questioned here,
announcements are posted here, and little by little the site is made better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until nothing happens. Stack Overflow's &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19514/186281"&gt;response time has become a meme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"6 to 8 weeks" is a joke. It's used to indicate that something isn't going to be built or changed. It's so prevalent that this
comment crops up over and over on feature request posts. It's used by the community to say that nothing is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something does happen, it's a "big deal". There have been a few examples in the past year. Unfortunately, these changes happened
due to feedback from Twitter, not Meta. For years we've been told to post on Meta. For years we've been told that Meta is where
the company will engage with us. Then two massive changes happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-welcoming"&gt;The Welcoming&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-welcoming" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first change was to make Stack Overflow more &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"&gt;"welcoming"&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't bad. As both an experienced user and as a
moderator, I've seen my fair share of users not being welcomed. I've seen hostility to poorly asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this whole blog post and resulting meta-drama &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to have cropped up because of a post on Twitter from
someone who felt unwelcome. That's fair. I believe they felt that way. However, from my point of view, Stack Overflow ignored
their own users (some of whom had been saying the exact same thing for years) because it was suddenly posted on Twitter where
the entire world could comment on things that may have been out of context. Instead of listening to their own users and the
experiences those users had, Stack Overflow went into damage control mode and rapidly &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/06/21/rolling-out-the-welcome-wagon-june-update/"&gt;updated it's "Be Nice" policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is actually what happened or not is really beside the point. Many long time users had this perception. Meta was
ignored. User feedback was ignored. Instead, the person that could shout the loudest and had made the most noise appeared to
be the one that was listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after the welcoming blog was posted and a month after the update, another post was made about how the company
was attempting to &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/07/10/welcome-wagon-classifying-comments-on-stack-overflow"&gt;classify comments&lt;/a&gt;. The idea behind this was good, the execution of the blog post was not. In the initial
version of the post, exact comments were posted to show "bad comments". I disagreed that a few of them were rude. I'd have removed them
as no longer needed without a problem. Honestly, I'd probably have removed them as rude too, because comments don't need to stick around
and it's easier to accept the rude flag than it is to decline and manually delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem was that the exact comment content was posted as a "wall of shame". Then, despite only employees being involved, none
of these comments were removed or even flagged for moderators to remove. In short, it really was a "wall of shame".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I covered my disappointment in both this failure and in the technical aspect in my &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/07/10/welcome-wagon-classifying-comments-on-stack-overflow/#comment-29001"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of automatically removing unwanted comments. I did so for several years. That said, Iâm disappointed in how
this is playing out here. Iâm disappointed on both a community level and a technical level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the community level, I am very disappointed that 57 Stack Exchange employees were able to evaluate bad comments, determine
they were bad enough to put in the hall of shame post here, and then do nothing about them. It took users less than 15 minutes
to find those comments on Stack Overflow and identify the ârudeâ users. Users who are rude because they asked why a certain
tag was on a question. Did none of your 57 users have a diamond where you could remove the comment from the site? Even if
thatâs the case, all of you have the option to flag a comment. Even that wasn't done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a technical level, you evaluated less than 4000 comments. That is a few hours worth of comments on a single week
day. (source: http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/872382) Is that really representative? How did you determine
which comments to use in your evaluation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the comment samples were edited to be "representative" of the problem later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming users is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. Helping users is the purpose of the site. I fully support all of that. What I don't support is
ignoring the feedback mechanism you've built and told everyone to use for years because someone else with a lot of Twitter
followers put Stack Overflow in a bad light. Yes, it should be fixed and should have been fixed sooner, but the perception
of "listen to the loudest shout" is not a good look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="removal-from-network-questions-list"&gt;Removal from Network Questions list&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#removal-from-network-questions-list" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the entire "Twitter shouted, Stack Overflow reacted" repeated itself. This time, a user was offended (while on
Stack Overflow) over the Hot Network Questions list for two questions on another Stack Exchange site. In under an hour,
Stack Overflow (the company) removed that question from the hot network questions list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community in question was shocked by the result. A community manager explained the decision on that &lt;a href="https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3335/34"&gt;site's meta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the solution we chose - without consulting IPS - because it was effective and easy to implement since it would
fix the perceived problem immediately and there was already a technical solution in place for doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice a couple things here that stand out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"perceived problem"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"without consulting IPS"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company knee-capped an entire community and a large source of their traffic (the Hot Network Questions list) because
of a single Twitter comment. Understandably, the community was upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes was even worse. On Twitter, the original user posting their complaint was engaged by community moderators.
It didn't go well. Then they complained about that. A Stack Overflow employee jumped into the thread with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the DM trolls claimed to be moderators on any of the sites then I'd like to follow up with the community team and see about
getting removed - they take this very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Stack Overflow doesn't value their community moderators. One employee might be misguided, but this Twitter
reply remained active and moderators across the network clamored for an official response. A moderator reached out to the Twitter
user in good faith and was threatened with removal by a Stack Overflow employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Stack Exchange's most respected moderators posted &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@cellio/dear-stack-overflow-we-need-to-talk-13bf3f90204f"&gt;their frustrations on Medium&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend you read it. One
of the community managers posted a &lt;a href="https://jericson.github.io/2018/10/24/lost_trust.html"&gt;response on their own blog&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/317264/186281"&gt;"super-official &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; response"&lt;/a&gt; was posted even later. This was more than 10 days after the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/316934/186281"&gt;original incident&lt;/a&gt;. It
took half a month for a first draft of a "moderator social media guidelines" post to be made in the private Stack Moderators Team.
That post consisted of bullet points on how a moderator should behave on social media. I replied to that post with this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am underwhelmed by this response. The event that led to this post and recent discussions around Stack Exchange (and the broader
internet) wasn't due to a moderator's bad behavior. Moderators engaged a user on Twitter following the bullets in this post, and
yet stuff still exploded in everyone's face. From my point of view, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; post is so far down the list of responses that I was
hoping to see from Stack Exchange that I'm feeling insulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked to hold my judgment until the final draft was posted. That took place in December - two months after the incident. It was
changed from "Social media guidelines" to a "community emergency process". These four bullets were provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce yourself and if necessary, your role as moderator of a SO/SE site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer to help with the situation, and be very respectful if someone declines your assistance. Sometimes, people just want to vent, and the best thing we can do to help is to give them space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of the volatile nature of online discussions; if the path to constructive discourse becomes blurred, it's often best to disengage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your interactions with others, concerning SO/SE, as clear and as kind as possible. If things begin to get out of hand, please disengage and let us know about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, do exactly what the moderator did initially on Twitter which resulted in the threat of being removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="communication"&gt;Communication&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow is slowly isolating itself from the community. There have been multiple comments scattered around the network
saying the employees don't want to engage on any meta. There are community managers that are feeling hated because of complaints
users have made. Users are taking out their anger of being ignored on posts talking about new or unrelated features. In turn,
the employees engage just a little bit less. Lines are being drawn. I see it as a moderator. I see it as a user. Very slowly
the community is trusting the company less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is becoming "us" vs. "them". There is "the company" vs. "the users". Blog posts, comments, meta discussions also appear
to be driving a wedge between "the users" and making it "new users" vs. "established users". In the blog post announcing
&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/03/28/the-next-ceo-of-stack-overflow/"&gt;the search for a new Stack Overflow CEO&lt;/a&gt;, this comment was made by the current CEO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing Iâm very concerned about, as we try to educate the next generation of developers, and, importantly, get more
diversity and inclusiveness in that new generation, is what obstacles weâre putting up for people as they try to learn programming.
In many ways Stack Overflowâs specific rules for what is permitted and what is not are obstacles, but an even bigger problem is
rudeness, snark, or condescension that newcomers often see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying sentiment - improving inclusiveness and diversity - is great. I'm all for that. The rest of it, though, is a dig
at the established community in the same way that the Welcoming blog post was. Stack Overflow's high quality standards are the
problem. It makes the community seem rude and abusive. You should stop closing those questions, stop down voting new users, and
just be nice. It doesn't say that directly, but that's how &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/381927/189134"&gt;existing members&lt;/a&gt; are seeing it. Read under &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/381935/189134"&gt;hairboat's answer&lt;/a&gt;
to see some of the simmering feelings of &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; reputation users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of trust between users and the company is brought up in the comments. This is just another example, in a long list,
where the community and the company are butting heads. Something happens that the community doesn't like - reacting to incidents off
site, focusing on features no one asked for, not explaining why these new features &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be done, comments are made
by one side that makes the other seem unflattering - and another round of not trusting the company starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has had a decade of experience with this community. It's grown, shrunk, and grown again. For most of that time, there has
been fairly open communication and trust. I am afraid that trust has eroded over the last few years and can't be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-can-be-done"&gt;What can be done?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-be-done" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company wants to focus on areas that can bring in more money. In my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/stack-overflows-problem-feedback-from-an-experienced-user.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I quoted the President and Chief Technology Officer
of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that there are a lot of issues on Stack Overflow that need to be addressed, and maybe we haven't been
responding to them as quickly as we should. But Stack Overflow Q&amp;amp;A is a big, established product, most of the problems left are
hard, and we can't let maintenance become the only thing we work on or we'll just slowly run out of money and go out of
business. We are trying to both maintain Q&amp;amp;A and solve new problems for developers and reach new audiences. The latter is hard,
and maybe we'll fail on a lot of our ideas, but we're not going to stop trying. â David Fullerton May 17 at 21:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bemoaned that this sounded that Q&amp;amp;A was feature frozen. It's been nearly two years since that time. I can't remember a new feature that
was introduced into Q&amp;amp;A that helped the community maintain high quality posts. There was a new wizard introduced for new users that
is supposed to help. A quick look at the review queue numbers on Stack Overflow shows that they are still stable at the same point it
was two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suggestion as a user, a moderator and someone interested in see Stack Overflow remain successful, is to focus on helping to manage
the quality of your content. Users have been asking &lt;em&gt;for years&lt;/em&gt; to be able to better handle poor content. They've asked for tools (both
system tools and moderator tools). There have been projects started, stopped, restarted, and stopped again that are supposed to
improve quality. Community tools have been built to help deal with quality problems. &lt;em&gt;Use some of this!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow has a data science team. Work with the community directly to help figure out ways to prevent low quality content from
ever getting posted. Force users - all users - to post higher quality content. Work with the communities that have developed automated
tools. Run it with larger data sets. Even if Stack Overflow has to be more conservative than the community tool, if you can prevent
&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the low quality content from making it to the site you have a victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the company can't ignore the areas that bring in revenue, but it's becoming increasingly clear that the community is
much less forgiving than they used to be. Continued communication blunders will not help with anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-to-from-here"&gt;Where to from here?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-to-from-here" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended my last post with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want Stack Overflow to continue to grow. I also want Stack Overflow to have high quality content. I think my experience
and the experience of others can help build the features to accomplish this. We just need Stack Overflow to refocus on the
Q&amp;amp;A portion of their network again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that holds true today, just as it did 18 months ago. The aspect of the site that draws users in is Q&amp;amp;A. Make it better. Make
the content better. Give users tools to make it better. With all of this, I believe, the "welcoming" aspect will improve. Let the system
handle the low quality stuff automatically. Eliminate the need for users to ask basic questions or remind users to post their code. Let
the system be "the bad guy", and let users interact and &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see how everything looks in 18 months. In the meantime, I'll be here, cleaning up the low quality content and prodding the
company to provide improvements to Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/></entry><entry><title>Upgrading the home network to use Ubiquiti products</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/ubiquiti-home-network.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-03-13T11:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-13T11:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2019-03-13:/ubiquiti-home-network.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My home network received a major upgrade. This post covers the new hardware and impressions a month after the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="routers-past"&gt;Routers past&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#routers-past" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not known for being gentle with routers at my house. I have pushed many consumer
grade routers to their limits and ended up replacing them for newer models or
competing models. My most recent model was an &lt;a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320115"&gt;ASUS RT-AC66U&lt;/a&gt;. I bought this
in 2015. It is one of the longer surviving routers in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-found-an-awesome-remote-only-job.html"&gt;working from home though&lt;/a&gt;, I've been noticing more problems.
These include randomly dropping all wireless connections, randomly losing connection
to the cable modem and frequently needing reboots to fix these problems. The issue
that finally made me start looking for another replacement was when the entire
router would reboot when a new wireless device connected to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was especially obnoxious when family members would come home and their phones
would reconnect to the home network. On more than one occasion a work call was
dropped, a college course interrupted or a review session with coworkers disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found myself adding smart home "things" to my house in the past few years.
I'd told myself that I didn't need smart plugs, smart lights, voice assistants,
and the like, but I received a free voice assistant at some point. I set it up and
the family got hooked. One voice assistant became two then more. I attached
smart plugs to Christmas lights "as an experiment" and found it worked way
better than I expected. Christmas ended and the plugs were re-purposed. I brought
in smart lights and out fitted my office with those. I have more, but haven't yet
expanded to other rooms. It's coming though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I have more devices than ever connected to the network and the wireless
router I had didn't seem up to the task of handling all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time for an upgrade. I didn't want just another router that I'd have to
replace in a few years though. I wanted something high quality and that could
handle anything I through at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="enter-ubiquti"&gt;Enter Ubiquti&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#enter-ubiquti" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't remember what brought [Ubiquiti][ubiquiti] to my attention years ago, but I
was immediately impressed with the hardware, the reviews and the price point. It
is not a home router, but it's also not a five figure price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research I what I'd need in the house. I needed to be able to support
several wired devices, even more wireless ones (computers, phones, tablets, and
home automation devices). I wanted to have a guest network like the previous ASUS,
so that I could easily give visitors access to the internet without giving them
access to everything on the network. I also wanted to segregate all of those
smart devices to their own network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trained as an information security professional. I understand the risks that
all of these devices can add. It's a lot of little mini-computers on the network.
I don't want an outlet plug compromising my house. I also don't have top secret
data, so a little risk for the sake of convenience is ok to me. If I could
put these devices on a network that is seperate from both the main network and
the guest network, that'd be good for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ubiquiti-devices"&gt;Ubiquiti Devices&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ubiquiti-devices" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of research on the &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/products/#default"&gt;devices Ubiquiti offers&lt;/a&gt;, I picked out the
ones that would be used. I'd be using the UniFi branded products instead of the
Edgemax branded products. From everything I was able to find, the hardware between
the two brands is how they are managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a network engineer. I work with some great ones at work and they
speak another technical language entirely. As useful as it'd be to know more
in that area for work, that's not a goal I wanted to pursue for a home project.
I went with UniFi because of it's easier management with the UniFi controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with the following devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg/"&gt;UniFi Security Gateway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-2448/"&gt;UniFi 24 port switch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-poe/"&gt;UniFi 24 port switch with PoE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/"&gt;UniFi AP AC Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-cloud-key/"&gt;UniFi Cloud Key (gen 1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="security-gateway"&gt;Security Gateway&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#security-gateway" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg/"&gt;security gateway&lt;/a&gt; is the router the handles the network. It's much
smaller than previous routers I've had. The purpose of this product is to provide
routing, not be the device everything in the network plugs into. That's the switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable modem plugs into WAN1 and the switch plugs into LAN1. That's it. Nice and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="24-port-switch"&gt;24 port switch&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#24-port-switch" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-2448/"&gt;24 port switch&lt;/a&gt; is the first switch I bought for this project. It was a mistake. The mistake
was mine though. The Access points are powered via power over ethernet. This switch doesn't
have that. The best I can come up with for how this mistake was made is that I had both the
PoE and non-PoE versions open when I went to order and put the wrong one in my cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it ended up being a happy mistake. I have more wired devices than I realized. Previously,
I had a router and a couple small switches scattered around the house to allow multiple devices
to be plugged in. If I'd just ordered the single 24 Port PoE switch, I'd have used well over half
of the ports immediately between the existing devices and the new access points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to keep this switch, and only plug in the wired and non-PoE devices into
this switch. Anything that needed to be powered via PoE would go into the PoE switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="24-port-switch-poe"&gt;24 port switch PoE&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#24-port-switch-poe" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-poe/"&gt;24 port PoE device&lt;/a&gt; is slightly deeper than the non-PoE version. It also has
case fans. I am using this device to power the access points I purchased. It was originally
going to power the cloud key too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="access-points"&gt;Access Points&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#access-points" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 5 pack of &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/"&gt;AC Pro access points&lt;/a&gt;. As I mentioned, these are
powered via power over ethernet. That means I needed to run wires to locations around
the house. That's an exercise I don't want to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've put up three of the five access points initially to see how much coverage
they provide to the house. So far, I am pleased with how they are performing. I'm
not sure where the last two will go yet, but I'll find a spot eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These access points are handling the three networks without any issues. The
trust home devices are on one network, the smart home devices are on another, and
a third guest network is used occasionally with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cloud-key-gen-1"&gt;Cloud Key (Gen 1)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-key-gen-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the device I wish I'd researched a little more before purchasing. I see
it's purpose, but I don't need it. I can run the UniFi controller on my Ubuntu
server. It took a little bit of work to get it installed because of port
conflicts with GitLab and poor error messages, but once that was figured out, it
works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other complaint about the first generation cloud key is that it just hangs from
the switch. The second generation is mountable (and performs more tasks for other)
Ubiquiti products. I purchased the first generation though and don't think I'll
ever use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="review"&gt;Review&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#review" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set up of all devices is very simple. Plug it in, set up your management
account on the UniFi controller, adopt the devices and you are set up. A little
configuration is needed to set up wireless networks, but that didn't take a lot
of work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the controller, updating the firmware of all devices is simple. If there
is an update, the controller lets you know and you click "update". Five minutes later,
the device reboots with the new firmware and everything works. I was able to update
everything within thirty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware of which devices are plugged into what. You don't want to reboot an upstream
device before the down stream ones are finished. For that reason, I updated the
access points first, then the switches, then the security gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since everything was set up, I haven't been disconnected from the cable modem once.
I haven't had the entire wireless network shutdown when a family member came home.
I haven't had any spots without coverage in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I have a brand new first world problem. A couple of the smart plugs I
have can only be configured on the 2.4Ghz band. The three access points I have cover
the entire house in a 5Ghz signal. To configure these plugs, I need to step out
into the yard to get outside of the 5Ghz range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of details available in the UniFi controller is amazing. I can see
signal strength of all wireless network devices. I can see nearby wireless networks
that I couldn't see with the previous router. I can see traffic patterns (I watch
a lot of video services). I even have the intrusion prevention system enabled
because my internet speed isn't fast enough to be impacted by the load this puts
on the security gateway. There is one persistent IP in Europe that likes to scan
me. Hi Netherlands! I see you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, everything I've thrown at this new set up has handled it like it was nothing.
That makes sense. These are business class products and are designed to handle way
more than I should be able to throw at it as a home user. I like a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's next though? I'd like to get even more information from the devices. A true
monitoring solution for the entire home network or at the least the network equipment
and the server. I've been investigating the &lt;a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/"&gt;TICK stack&lt;/a&gt; for gathering metrics.
I'll see if I can set something like that up in a way that I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to expand wireless coverage out to the shed. I'm not sure if I can
do that with the access points though. I don't want to run an ethernet cord out
there (and bury it). That's really far down on my wish list though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Fixing XPS 13 (Ubuntu) and Thunder Bolt 16 issue after BIOS update</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/xps-tb16-bios-fix.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-31T10:30:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-31T10:30:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2019-01-31:/xps-tb16-bios-fix.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updating BIOS using a Dell provided update broke how my Thunder Bolt dock and XPS interacted. This is how I fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="what-happened"&gt;What happened?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-happened" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November of 2018, Dell released a &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drivers/driversdetails?driverId=T7XJF&amp;amp;osCode=WT64A&amp;amp;productCode=xps-13-9360-laptop"&gt;BIOS update&lt;/a&gt; (version 2.10.0) for my XPS 13 9360 running Ubuntu 18.04.1. Among the enhancements
this updated added was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced the stability of Linux operating system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="BIOS Update available" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/update-available.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been putting off updating due to squeamishness involving touching the BIOS. If it goes poorly, it could make my day really
stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's currently -50 with the windchill outside. Schools are closed. Businesses are closed. Even the Post Office has said they aren't
delivering mail because it's so cold. This sounds like the perfect time to perform an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was my mistake...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the update and rebooting the machine, the XPS froze as the Ubuntu login screen was loading. There was only a
mouse cursor on an otherwise black screen. The mouse didn't respond to input from the touch pad or from a USB mouse. The keyboard
didn't appear to be responding either. The external monitors weren't receiving a signal and, finally, an attempt to SSH into the laptop failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="troubleshooting"&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop was entirely unresponsive. First step: "Did you reboot it?" Yes. I had to hold down the power button so it wasn't a clean reboot.
The exact same symptoms occurred: Black screen with only a mouse cursor right before the login page loads. Doesn't respond to any input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I unplugged everything. The laptop is plugged into a Thunder Bolt 16 docking station so that I can utilize two external
monitors. I also have Logitech headphones plugged into one of the USB ports and an external keyboard and mouse. Then I rebooted again by
holding down the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, everything worked. The login screen popped up, the machine responded to input events and everything was fine. Victory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started plugging stuff back in: Keyboard, then mouse, then headphones. No problems. Then I plugged in the Thunder Bolt docking station. A few
seconds later, the screen went black and stopped responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few reboots and a few tests of plugging in the dock, I realized that it was the dock causing the laptop issues. When it was plugged into
the wall adapter, it worked fine. The docking station was causing the problem. This isn't great, but at least the laptop works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rolling-back-bios"&gt;Rolling back BIOS&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#rolling-back-bios" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was time to roll back the BIOS. An update broke it, the original version should fix it...hopefully. The first step was
finding the old version - 2.9.0. Fortunately, Dell's support is helpful in this one single way. There is a page for old drivers and I quickly
found the &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/drivers/driversdetails?driverId=RCKDK&amp;amp;osCode=WT64A&amp;amp;productCode=xps-13-9360-laptop"&gt;System BIOS version 2.9.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform the roll back, there are only a few steps you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a USB drive that is formatted with FAT32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the BIOS file to the drive and leave it plugged into the XPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the XPS is plugged in (with the wall adapter, not the Thunder Bolt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the Dell splash screen press &lt;kbd class="light"&gt;F12&lt;/kbd&gt; to open the One Time Boot Menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "BIOS Flash Update"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the file you downloaded on the USB drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait patiently as BIOS is flashed again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the flashing was done, I was back to BIOS 2.9.0. Ubuntu restarted...and the same issue occurred. Plugging in the Thunder Bolt made the
laptop seize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dell-support"&gt;Dell Support&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#dell-support" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the BIOS reflash a failure, I turned to Dell support. I didn't have high expectations going in to this. Yet, somehow, I came out even
more disappointed. Through two phone calls, I was informed that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell doesn't support Ubuntu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is despite that fact that the laptop came with Ubuntu installed by Dell &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the BIOS update was from Dell. Since my operating system
was not Windows, I couldn't get any support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to the Dell Community forums. After some private back and forth with a community moderator (and Dell Social Media Support employee), I
was given this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I do not think that the TB16 or XPS hardware are at fault here. I think that the BIOS update broke the laptop USB Type-C.
Not physically, but in the operating system. So even though you backflashed, the issue remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was encouraged to test the Thunder Bolt with another Dell laptop. It's fortunate that my wife has a Dell for her work. Without it, I
wouldn't have been able to get this message when attempting to flash the Thunder Bolt firmware I was pointed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error: Collecting Dock Information failed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never heard back from Dell support after providing them with a screenshot of that error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inspiration"&gt;Inspiration&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#inspiration" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the quote from the forum moderator above doesn't make much sense. How can the BIOS update break the USB Type-C port in the operating system?
How can it not be fixed by going to a previous version?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me: There was more to this BIOS update. A day earlier I'd updated the kernel and hadn't rebooted yet and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uname&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r
&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;.15.0-44-generic
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with that, the phrase "Thunder Bolt" and Google, I stumbled across a post on &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1113954/183377"&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; with the same issue. Of course.
Why didn't I start there? I had been chasing the wrong thing. BIOS wasn't the cause, it was just the reason for the system reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fix"&gt;Fix&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#fix" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix involved going back to the previous kernel. I didn't follow the &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1113954/183377"&gt;Ask Ubuntu post&lt;/a&gt; exactly. First, I edited by grub configuration to display the
grub menu. This is at &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/grub&lt;/code&gt;. I changed the &lt;code&gt;GRUB_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; and uncommented &lt;code&gt;GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;. After saving that config file
I ran &lt;code&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the grub menu appeared, I selected "Advanced Boot Options" and then selected the &lt;code&gt;4.15.0-43-generic&lt;/code&gt; kernel and continued the boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu loaded. It stayed responsive when I swapped from the wall adapter to the Thunder Bolt dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the XPS working again, I have decided to stay on BIOS 2.9.0 for now. I also haven't re-updated the kernel to the &lt;code&gt;-44&lt;/code&gt; version. In fact, I purged that one
for the time being with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get purge -f linux-image-4.15.0-44-generic
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1813663"&gt;known bug&lt;/a&gt; with 4.15.0-44 and a fix is being worked on. It also seems to impact more than just Dell products. It looks like
4.15.0-45 will fix the issue. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Dell support is less helpful than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Sanic - An Asynchronous Web Framework for Pythonistas Udemy course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/sanic-webframework-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-23T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-23T10:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2019-01-23:/sanic-webframework-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Sanic Web Framework fro Pythonistas course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work we are starting to write version 2 of our API. As part of this new version, we're migrating from PHP to Python (hooray!). There are various technical
reasons for this, but I am excited. My technical skills are much (&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;) better in Python. Part of this migration involved decided the framework we'd be using
and after several internal discussions, we settled on &lt;a href="https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Sanic&lt;/a&gt;. The first line of the documentation reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanic is a Flask-like Python 3.5+ web server thatâs written to go fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! I used Flask at my previous job. To be clear, Sanic is not &lt;em&gt;based on&lt;/em&gt; Flask, but it's API is &lt;em&gt;Flask-like&lt;/em&gt;. Good enjoy to start with. With the framework
set, and previous experience with a similar framework, I wanted to go through how Sanic works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to Udemy and the &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/sanic-an-asynchronous-web-framework-for-pythonistas/"&gt;Sanic - an asynchronous web framework for Pythonistas&lt;/a&gt; course, created by SzabÃ³ DÃ¡niel ErnÅ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is roughly two hours long and consists of 20 tutorial videos. Each one is less than 10 minutes long. It covers a wide range of features available in
Sanic. The instructor made their code available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/r3ap3rpy/sanic-web-framework"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I never actually used the GitHub repository though. Instead, I followed along with the brief
tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this speaks to the instructor's ability to keep the lessons and code short and simple yet effectively show how a single feature works. By making the
code easy enough to type and follow along, the lesson was more effective because I was &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; instead of just reading code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few lessons are a little rough, because the recordings stutter like the machine that was doing the recording wasn't powerful enough. After 5-6 lessons
this clears up. It's a minor thing but I do feel it's something that should have been fixed before the course was posted. One other annoyance was that each
lesson contains the same boiler plate code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;sanic&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"localhost"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson code will then go after the &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; variable is defined. The problem with this boiler plate code is that the instructor types it out every single lesson.
Again, this is minor and it makes each lesson self contained, but I think having this code already written and adding in the important, lesson specific code,
would have made the lesson more succinct. It also would have prevented a few typos that the instructor made and had to spend time correcting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons themselves were effective at teaching a single Sanic feature. Some were a little short and almost all of them lacked any complexity you'd find in
a real application, but they were quick ways to show how a feature worked and didn't spend a lot of time doing more than that. Lessons covered a variety of
things you'd expect a web framework to handle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request Parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listeners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blueprints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request Types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in the error handling lesson, the instructor had an error in their code. This is great, because it helps to see how to troubleshoot errors that Sanic
can throw. My issue is that the instructor left the time where he's looking at another monitor (probably reading documentation) in the video. I feel this time
could have been removed and the troubleshooting steps still been effectively shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I was happy with this course. It's about two hours long and does a good job of showing various aspects of Sanic. I don't recall ever being pointed
to the documentation, which is a little surprising, but it was easy enough to find. The course provides a good foundation of knowing what Sanic can handle. As
of the time of this post, Udemy says there have been ten students that signed up for the course. That is low and the lack of Q&amp;amp;A is also a bit concerning. I
don't know how responsive the instructor is to student questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a few hours (and dollars, during a Udemy sale) to spare and wish to learn some basics about Sanic, this is a good course to take. If not, the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/r3ap3rpy/sanic-web-framework"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; contains all of the lessons you go over.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a walkthrough of how I set it up.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html"&gt;migrated from Wordpress to Pelican&lt;/a&gt; for this blog. I set it up to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html"&gt;run on GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I've
been happy with that set up. I can modify my template as needed (which is infrequent), I can publish a post relatively easily
and can write the entire post in MarkDown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was room for improvement though. The way I originally set it up required me to push to two different repositories
every time I wrote a new blog post. Once for the MarkDown file and images, and once for the generated HTML. I wanted to
eliminate the need for me to perform the second step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="previously-on-this-blog"&gt;Previously on this blog&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#previously-on-this-blog" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, this blog was broken into two repositories. One was the "source" and one was the generated HTML. In my development
environment, there was also my local theme and a clone of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins"&gt;Pelican plugins repository&lt;/a&gt;, but I never formalized these
into curated repositories. The generated HTML was a submodule of the source repository and was placed in the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt;
directory. I used the following command to generate HTML each time I created a new post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican content --output output --settings publishconf.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using my settings, this would generate my HTML in the output directory. After this was generated, I'd push the content repository
which had a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; rule to ignore the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory, and then I'd push the output directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this, I had a &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; document so that I could theoretically generate a post from anywhere, but I failed to keep
that updated an in sync with my development environment. On more than one occasion, I tried to write a post on my laptop (not my usual
development machine) and failed due to the mismatched dependencies, missing theme and missing plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My development environment was fragile and couldn't be replicated with what I'd posted on GitHub. I'd also forgotten to push the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt;
directory on more than one occasion, which was annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out to change all of this with the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only a single push to GitHub would generate and deploy the HTML for this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should be able to clone the appropriate repositories and generate content locally in an emergency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It'd be nice to have true separation between the content of the site (the MarkDown articles) and the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="warning"&gt;Warning&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#warning" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I made a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html"&gt;public post about how poorly Travis CI handles secure environment variables&lt;/a&gt;. The public
&lt;a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9430"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; hasn't been worked on yet. The two issues identified still persist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure variables can be show via simple string manipulation from a malicious commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure variables are transferred to a third party if the repository is transferred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that the still need to be addressed. They are security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I am using a Travis CI secure environment variable in my deployment script. It is the GitHub token used to push
to the repository that contains generated HTML. I have chosen to do this because I am the only one that will be committing
to the repository and will not be transferring it to a 3rd party. This is a personal site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alternatives if you don't like the idea of storing your token with Travis CI. I've accepted that risk, even though I
believe the issue should be fixed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="improved-deployment"&gt;Improved Deployment&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#improved-deployment" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my goals in place, I started with the "nice to have", because...this isn't work and I can prioritize how I want. I split my
blog into three repositories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content"&gt;awegnergithub.github.io-content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source"&gt;awegnergithub.github.io-source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io"&gt;awegnergithub.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="content"&gt;Content&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#content" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content"&gt;content repository&lt;/a&gt; is the one repository that I commit MarkDown to. This would be the repository that triggers new deployments
and would be the one that changes most frequently. Other than a single &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, the only thing in this repository would be
content that is used on the site. It'd be my MarkDown articles, associated images, and meta files (&lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt;, and verification files)
but wouldn't contain any Pelican code, plugins or theme information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="source"&gt;Source&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#source" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source"&gt;source repository&lt;/a&gt; is where Pelican source code lives. This repository already existed in my first iteration of the blog. I needed to
pull out the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directories and add in the theme and plugins that had only existed locally. I also updated &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;
to contain all of the dependencies I needed to generate the site correctly. I am pretty embarrassed to admit that I hadn't updated this file in almost
three years, except to fix a plugin that had broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had Pelican pinned to an old version that I hadn't used in over a year and I was missing dependencies that the Pelican plugins required. This took
a lot more time to hunt down than I expected, and it's entire my fault for not keeping this updated over the years. Fortunately, with the setup, I have
to keep this updated or the site won't generate correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="generated-content"&gt;Generated Content&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#generated-content" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; is the one that holds the generated HTML for this blog. This already existed and continues to serve exactly the same
purpose as before. The only difference is that the content should be pushed to this repository automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-up"&gt;Set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="github-token"&gt;GitHub Token&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#github-token" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the three repositories set up and content committed to them as appropriate, the next step is setting up the single Travis CI environment
variable we'll need. This will be the Personal Access Token used to commit to the generated content repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, navigate to GitHub, select your avatar in the upper right, and select "Settings". On the left, select "Developer settings" then
"Personal access tokens".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click "Generate new token" and enter your password as appropriate. Provide a useful description for your token and under the &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; scope,
select only &lt;code&gt;public_repo&lt;/code&gt;. If you are planning on committing to a private repository, you will need to select the entire &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; scope. Since my
generated content isn't hosted in a private repository, the &lt;code&gt;public_repo&lt;/code&gt; is enough. Select "Generate token" at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GitHub Token Selection" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/build_blog_github_token.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be presented with your token. &lt;strong&gt;Copy this someplace, you won't be able to access this value again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="travis-ci-environment-variable"&gt;Travis CI Environment Variable&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#travis-ci-environment-variable" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this token needs to be accessible in Travis CI. Navigate to &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; and find your &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; repository. Under "More Options",
on the left select "Settings". Scroll down to "Environment Variables". In my &lt;code&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; script, I use the variable &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;,
so that is what I'll use here too. Enter the variable name and the token GitHub provided in the previous step. Do not change "Display value
in build log" to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and press "Add".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GitHub Token Selection" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/build_blog_github_envvariable.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="deploysh"&gt;deploy.sh&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#deploysh" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is configuring the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/a24583e590b8a5ec8377433b953abff31fdbfabb/deploy.sh"&gt;&lt;code&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; script in the source repository. For my configuration, all that is needed is
changing the &lt;code&gt;GH_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt; variable to be the name of the user hosting the blog. Still, there is more to the script, if you
find this and wish to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few areas that may be important. The first is that pushes to the generated repository are done with the username "Travis CI" and
an associated Travis CI email address. Change these as you wish. I didn't want them in my name, so that I could easily pick out which commits
I did versus which ones were done automatically. The old commits in my name vs. the new automated commits look like this in GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blog commit differences" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/build_blog_github_commits.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important line of code is this one in the deploy script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;GH_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GITHUB_API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TARGET_REPO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line pushes the generated site to the appropriate repository using the &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt; we previously generated and told
Travis CI about. It also sends all output of this command to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; so that the secure key won't show up in the build log. If
this isn't done, Travis CI will print out the command and may or may not properly obscure it (see my previous warning, above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment ends by pinging Google and Bing with my &lt;code&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt;. This is an automated way of telling the two search engines
that the site has been updated and they should recheck the sitemap and reindex as appropriate. It doesn't guarantee they will
crawl the site immediately, but it does let them know their is an update before their next scheduled crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="travisyml"&gt;.travis.yml&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#travisyml" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we need to tell Travis CI what to do when there is a commit made to the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; repository. The only non-content file
in this repository is &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content/blob/4cafca4c768a9eb291e84760ebeb0df576ab82c4/.travis.yml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have it building against Python 3.5 simply because that is the version I have installed and utilize most often. There is
no reason this blog wouldn't generate against 3.6 or 3.7. I'm pretty sure all of the dependencies will also work against 2.7
right now too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will only build when I commit to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch. I don't use other branches right now, but if I ever do, they won't trigger a build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important bits are in the &lt;code&gt;before_script&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;before_script:
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; git clone https://github.com/AWegnerGithub/awegnergithub.github.io-source.git source
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; mkdir source/content
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; rsync -av --progress ./* source/content --exclude source
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; cd source
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; pip install --upgrade pip
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; pip install -r requirements.txt
script:
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; pelican content --output output --settings publishconf.py --verbose
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;before_script&lt;/code&gt;, I clone my &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; repository containing all my Pelican settings into the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; directory. Next, I add a &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;
directory into this newly created &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; directory. I &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; my content to this directory and exclude &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; because you can't
recursively copy a directory into itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I get my dependancies installed. I update &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; and install my &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, I execute the same &lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;/code&gt; command I
previously used and add on the &lt;code&gt;verbose&lt;/code&gt; flag, just in case I need to troubleshoot a failed build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment is done via the &lt;code&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; block, but all it is doing is calling my &lt;code&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; script that I covered above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;skip_cleanup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;skip_cleanup&lt;/code&gt; is important to leave as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; so that the output from the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; block isn't cleaned up before we deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post should be the first one that is automatically deployed. I'm sure there are improvements I can and will make to my
&lt;code&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; script or &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; over time, but right now I'm happy with how it works. In testings, a deployment is taking
about a minute or two from the time I push a new article. This is about how long it took previously, but now I only need to
perform a single push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also happy with the split of my repositories. I was never a huge fan of having content and source code mashed together, but
it worked. Now, I can keep the two separate and easily determine where everything is. Template changes are source code, article
changes are content. If I make changes to anything other than content, I can trigger a rebuild within Travis CI with the click
of a button. If I am just adding an article, I just need to wait a few minutes for it to be built and deployed. Hooray for
automation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing this split may have done is make it easier to eventually add comments to the blog. That's been a long term
goal and one that I've investigated off and on over the past three years. Since I host everything via GitHub Pages and
don't have a database, comments would probably need to be done via GitHub comments somehow. I have ideas, but haven't started
testing any of those yet. This split will make it easier, I think, when or if I investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="Pelican"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's Docker Swarm: Beginner + Advanced</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/docker-swarm-beginner-advanced.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-10-31T15:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-10-31T15:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-10-31:/docker-swarm-beginner-advanced.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Docker Swarm: Beginner + Advanced&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found short two courses about Docker on Udemy there were listed as free by the author as they get ready to update the course. This is a review of &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-swarm-from-beginner-to-advanced-with-docker-cluster-hosting/"&gt;Docker Swarm: Beginner + Advanced&lt;/a&gt; by Luke Angel. This is the second course I've reviewed by this author. The previous course was reviewed &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/docker-essentials-course.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a very basic idea of what the container/microservice architecture is designed to solve. I've never used it professionally or on personal projects. My experience is limited to reading articles about technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes and thinking that I'd like to try those out at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another hour long course and promises "foundational knowledge" by the end of the course. I disagree with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course starts with a lecture that is essentially an ad (almost in the form of a TV episode trailer) for the course. There are duplicate lectures, which seems to be a recurring problem based on the same issue in the previous course. Another problem that has carried over from the previous course is audio issues and inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a beginner course, despite the name. The author assumes knowledge of Docker and does not explain concepts when the "demo" starts. Speaking of the "demo", this isn't a true demonstration of the product. Instead, the author provides a ZIP file of commands that are run and outputs of those commands. In the lectures, a few elements of the output are highlighted and explained. I didn't find this to be a useful demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a course that is several years old. It is not well put together, with multiple lectures being duplicated. Sound issues plague the presentation throughout the hour. These are all similar complaints to the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/docker-essentials-course.html"&gt;previous course&lt;/a&gt;. This course also includes a demonstration, that is really just looking at the output of an attached text file. For a demonstration, I was expecting to be able to follow along, as as this is "Beginner + Advanced", I was expecting some kind of instructions on how to set up my environment. There is none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't recommend this course (or the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/docker-essentials-course.html"&gt;previous one&lt;/a&gt;) because of how little "useful" content is fit into these two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found short two courses about Docker on Udemy there were listed as free by the author as they get ready to update the course. This is a review of &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-containers-the-essentials/"&gt;Docker and Containers: The Essentials&lt;/a&gt; by Luke Angel. There is a third free Docker course by the same author as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a very basic idea of what the container/microservice architecture is designed to solve. I've never used it professionally or on personal projects. My experience is limited to reading articles about technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes and thinking that I'd like to try those out at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is a one hour, very high level, overview of what containers are. The course description mentions that there won't be detailed developer examples, and this is true. My issue with the course is that it is to high level. This course is not for anyone with even a tiny idea of what a container is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author has basically created an hour long, narrated Power Point presentation. Even worse, there are at least two instances of lecture that are duplicated (and are pointed out in the community feedback and Q&amp;amp;A section). The narration is obviously edited from multiple microphones and the sound consistency is uneven. The author also spends lectures typing on their keyboard while talking. This is loud and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivational speaking makes it into one of the final lectures, explaining that we are winners for being on the right track by studying Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a course that is several years old. It is not well put together, with multiple lectures being duplicated. Sound issues plague the presentation throughout the hour. The content of the course is accurate - as of a few years ago - but has areas that are outdated at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how long the author is spending on updating their courses, but there is a lot that needs to be done in just this one hour course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: This course is no longer offered on Udemy. There are more recent version and courses for a Git introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Git extensively in both my personal and professional work. I've set up &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; for my personal work. I know enough about Git to be effective in a small environment with a handful of developers. I found a 30 minute crash course about Git on Udemy and decided to take it with the goal of learning a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course I found was &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/git-complete-the-30-minute-crash-course-to-learning-git/"&gt;The 30 minute crash course to learning GIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/git-complete-the-30-minute-crash-course-to-learning-git/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; by Ricardo Morales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler&lt;/em&gt;: I rated this course poorly on Udemy and since that rating, the course name has been changed to "The 2018 Git Complete: 45 minute Crash Course using Angular". The course has been updated slightly to add 15 more minutes of content since I completed the course. I have watched those as well and have not changed my rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took this course it was definitely incomplete. The very first lesson starts with "In our previous lecture...". Obviously, as the first lecture, there isn't a previous one. The 15 minutes of new content does add a few introduction lectures before this, so it's not as jarring, but the order of lectures is still out of order. There are next instances of "In the next lecture I'll cover..." and then the next lecture is something else, or "In the last lecture we talked about..." and the mentioned topic was a few lectures ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is a very quick run down of common Git commands. Very quick. Most lessons are under a minute in length. What this means is that there is almost no explanation about the command you're about to learn. In most of the lectures, it's a quick reading of the command's "help" sentence, then typing the command in a terminal window to show the syntax. Unfortunately, there isn't an over all project and the order of the lectures is out of order, so it's difficult to see how a particular command actually works since there isn't any set up done ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of how this is poorly demonstrated is in the lecture on renaming a file. The example uses &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt; to rename a file, talks about how it's been renamed, and then uses &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt; to rename it back to the original name to that there "won't be problems with Git." The entire point of the lecture is to show how this should be accomplished and this lecture misses it's mark entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is in the lessons on handling merge conflicts. This is an important topic because conflicts need to be handled when multiple developers are working on the same thing. The lecture on handling these though talks about the theory of handling it but doesn't provide a demo. The same thing is done in the topic on rebasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minute long lectures are not a good format. The lessons are rushed to the point where there is almost no content. Reading the "help" sentence and then showing the syntax doesn't make this a crash course. It makes it an audio/visual help document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about Git, avoid this course. If you don't know anything about Git, I'd avoid it too, unless you prefer listening to help documents instead of reading them. There isn't any novel content here. Examples are lacking, at best. Lectures are out of order and when I took it, missing entirely. The newly renamed course to include "using Angular" is incredibly misleading. Angular is used only to generate a project that can be committed to Git. Nothing done here uses Angular other than generating that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about Git, there is nothing here you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

This walks through how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server has been running for almost nine months. It's been backing up family data and pictures from phones without any problems. Now it's time to back up the laptop because I have the space and really should make sure the stuff that isn't work related (ie. the stuff that is in the work git repositories) is also backed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://rsync.samba.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to"&gt;How To&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to automatically back up my home directory from the laptop to the server on a daily basis. This will provide a once a day backup and if I need to do more than that in the future, it will be as easy as modifying the final cronjob that I'll use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ssh-key"&gt;SSH Key&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ssh-key" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is setting up an SSH key so that I don't have to manually provide a password. I can, in the future, add restrictions on the server side as to what this particular key will be able to do too. I'm not doing that today though, because I don't open SSH to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is generate a new key. I already have an SSH key configured, but it has a password. On the laptop, run the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/laptop-rsync-key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to enter a passphrase, simply press enter and then enter again to confirm the empty passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will put &lt;code&gt;laptop-rsync-key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;laptop-rsync-key.pub&lt;/code&gt; in my user's &lt;code&gt;.ssh/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="copy-the-public-key-to-the-server"&gt;Copy the public key to the server&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#copy-the-public-key-to-the-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to copy the public key that was just generated to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;laptop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;andy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;@192.168.140.187&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:~/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it's been copied, log into the server. Now you need to add this key to the &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ~/.ssh
cat laptop-rsync-key.pub &amp;gt;&amp;gt; authorized_keys
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rsync-command"&gt;rsync command&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#rsync-command" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final command to back up my home directory is pretty simple. This command is going to tell &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; to use the new SSH key that was just created, to exclude all dot files and directories, and to delete anything that has been removed on the laptop from the server. The backup will go in &lt;code&gt;~/backup/laptop&lt;/code&gt; on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;"ssh -i ~/.ssh/laptop-rsync-key"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;andy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@nas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;backup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;laptop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;--exclude=".*" --exclude=".*/" --delete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I confirmed this worked, I added it to my user's crontab on the laptop. It will run once a day now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next steps&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps I'll take be taking are to restrict the new SSH key on the server to only allow it to perform &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; tasks. This can be done by slightly modifying the appropriate line in &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;. I'll see how this daily, single, back up works for a while. If I need to, I may change it to a rotating weekly backup. I don't forsee that right now, but I need a few weeks of seeing how this works and if the single day is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's Learn DaVinci Resolve 15 from scratch</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/learn-davinci-resolve-15-from-scratch.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-09-21T09:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-09-21T09:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-09-21:/learn-davinci-resolve-15-from-scratch.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Learn DaVinci Resolve 15 from scratch course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: This course is no longer offered on Udemy. DaVinci 15 is out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I've done a course review. I wanted to try something new in an area that seems interesting, but I'm not sure if I want to do anything with it hobby-wise. &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/davinci-resolve-15-from-scratch/"&gt;Learn DaVinci Resolve 15 from scratch&lt;/a&gt; caught my attention, and I found a coupon code that allowed me to take the course for free. Video editting sounds interesting and I always have the "do something with family videos" on my very distant TODO list. The course is two and a half hours long and it seems to be a basic class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/"&gt;DaVinci Resolve&lt;/a&gt; is a very powerful, professional piece video editing software. The free version has everything I'd ever need for home use or even YouTube content. The paid version adds in multi-user collaboration features, additional 3D tools and new Resolve FX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course focuses heavily on learning the &lt;em&gt;interface&lt;/em&gt; of DaVinci Resolve. There are a few basic tutorials and the author promises more in the future. This isn't exactly what I was expecting with a course description that includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use DaVinci Resolve to create beautiful and stunning videos for the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it does provide a good overview of each of the tabs in DaVinci Resolve. The explanation of what each tab is used for and the very basic examples of how to use each give users an idea of how powerful DaVinci Resolve can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an overview of the interface for DaVinci Resolve, this course is good. As a "learn from scratch" course, the interface overview quickly shows that two and a half hours isn't enough time to learn the software beyond the very basics. The title is a bit misleading and as someone who didn't know anything about DaVinci Resolve and only took this course because of a potentially budding hobby, I was hoping for more than a two hour tutorial on where to click in the interface to do the basics. Alas, my ignorance of the topic meant I wasn't able to judge the course accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had several nit-picks with the content too. For one, I was immediately turned off to the course creator when they begged in the first lecture to not give them bad reviews. That isn't the type of thing I expect from someone who's put time and effort into creating the course. I was worried when this was done, but it turned out to be better than the begging implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second complaint is about how the content is presented. This is a course on &lt;em&gt;video editting&lt;/em&gt;. I expect a certain amount of care to be put into the presentation of such a topic, but the course wasn't well paced. There are very abrupt endings to several lectures. There are other lectures that have long periods of silence at the end. There are also more than a few occasions where the audio and video seem to be out of sync. You never see the instructor, but when they are presenting a new tab and say something like "Click on this tab" and then the mouse doesn't move to the tab for a few seconds it makes it hard to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final complaint is how incomplete the course is. There is one five second lecture that is just "This lecture will be uploaded very soon". The last bonus lecutre ends with "See you at the next lecture", but there are no more lectures. I realize the course was released this month, but it's incomplete. The full price of the course is $80. I expect more to be completed for that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good overview of the DaVinci Resolve environment. I understand what each tab is and how I can use them for basic edits. I feel comfortable enough to make a very simple video with some home videos now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are paying for the course, you should avoid it for a while. It's not complete. There is no guarantee that additional lectures will be added and the promise of "more to come" isn't worth the full price. If you are looking for an overview of the most important buttons in DaVinci Resolve, this is a good course. If you are looking for details on what every button or menu option is going to do, this course doesn't cover that. Finally, if you are really looking to "learn DaVinci Resolve" and not "learn the DaVinci Resolve interface", this isn't the best course either. There are some tutorials here, but they are not the majority of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background-and-goals"&gt;Background and goals&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#background-and-goals" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I am the software QA team lead (I haven't given myself a fancy title, but I should). As such, I spend a lot of time in JIRA tracking our bug and feature requests and in Slack working with every aspect of the company to ensure the new features work as expected and bugs as appropriately squashed. As new releases approach their release date, I start running more queries to ensure everything will be done on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini-rant: I hate JIRA's UI. It's slow, clunky and makes rolling things up as I need them unnecessarily complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that complaint, JIRA is good because it has so much flexibility on the web UI and, even better, it has an API I can use to automate the queries I use. So, that's what I did. Our last release was larger and more complex than the ones we've done in the last year (since I started). The reason for this complexity was that we needed to coordinate our updates with those of our third party billing platform. Messing up how we bill customers is a great way to get into a "discussion" with the higher ups at any company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release, I started poking around &lt;a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis/"&gt;JIRA's API&lt;/a&gt;. With very little work, I'd managed to automatically run the queries that were taking a significant amount of time in the UI. I formatted these nicely and started posting the results in Slack during our update calls so that all of the developers were on the same page. From my point of view, these calls were more efficient. After the release was pushed out, I decided to see what it'd take to make these queries available to everyone via a Slack slash command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will talk about the process I went through, give a small tutorial for a basic command, explain how I tested locally, provide a few tips that deal with pitfalls I encountered and explain how I deployed this to Google's cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="writing-the-flask-app"&gt;Writing the Flask app&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#writing-the-flask-app" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/slash-commands"&gt;Slack's slash apps&lt;/a&gt; do not run on Slack's platform. When a slash command is issued, it calls a predefined URL and awaits a response. My experience is with Python. I've used both Flask and Django web frameworks. These commands will be small and don't need any of the back end batteries that Django includes, so I chose to use Flask to handle the commands I wanted to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="slash-pitfall-1-timeouts"&gt;Slash Pitfall 1: Timeouts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#slash-pitfall-1-timeouts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pitfall that I encountered was before I even started writing code. Slack only allows a slash command 3000 milliseconds to respond, before it times out. Unfortunately, connecting to JIRA and running the series of queries I need takes a minimum of 5 seconds. Fortunately, the workaround for this was simple: Use &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/slash-commands#responding_response_url"&gt;delayed responses&lt;/a&gt; by responding to the initial command with a confirmation message of some kind, then perform the work and respond again using the Slack passed &lt;code&gt;response_url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-application"&gt;Sample Application&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#sample-application" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application code below is a simple toy example. It will respond to the command "/hello-world" and then reply again after a few seconds, to simulate the delayed responses I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wraps&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is used when running locally. Gunicorn is used to run the&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-application-walkthrough"&gt;Sample Application Walkthrough&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#sample-application-walkthrough" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only interesting thing in the imports here is the inclusion of &lt;code&gt;asyncio&lt;/code&gt;. Since I need to fire off an immediate response and then do the "real work", I'll funnel that work into worker threads. I'm also including &lt;code&gt;functools.wraps&lt;/code&gt; because I'm making a decorator for validating a request is coming from Slack. For a single command, this type of decorator isn't needed, but I have multiple Slack slash commands in the real application. I figured it'd be helpful to show here too. This application will also need the &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of that decorator, the first function encountered in the code is &lt;code&gt;validate_request&lt;/code&gt;. This will be the decorator that ensures a request came from Slack. It calls &lt;code&gt;is_request_valid&lt;/code&gt;, which compares the passed &lt;code&gt;token&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;team_id&lt;/code&gt; to the values we've previously saved. If they match, the request is valid. If they don't match, the request is invalid. This application is only for my team and won't be distributed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;code&gt;slack_command_response&lt;/code&gt;, which is used to send text back to Slack. It will respond to the &lt;code&gt;response_url&lt;/code&gt; parameter. This is passed by Slack and is part of the &lt;code&gt;request.form&lt;/code&gt; object Flask receives. This can be found at &lt;code&gt;request.form['response_url']&lt;/code&gt;. It will reply either &lt;code&gt;ephemeral&lt;/code&gt; (default) or &lt;code&gt;in_channel&lt;/code&gt;. The first will reply only to the user and will hide the slash command that was used. The second will reply to the entire channel and will leave the slash command visible to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting the worker thread is done in &lt;code&gt;start_command_worker&lt;/code&gt; and the next three lines. This will fire up a thread that listens forever. It will not take place on the main thread, which allows Flask to respond immediately and then perform work in the background. Remember, this is a small application and will work for the scale me and my team will be using this on. This is most certainly not designed for a huge number of users constantly using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to get to the real work. &lt;code&gt;hello_world&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;command_hello_world&lt;/code&gt;. If you've used Flask before, you can see that &lt;code&gt;command_hello_world&lt;/code&gt; will be the function associated with a user hitting &lt;code&gt;http:\\server.tld\hello-world&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request. Slack only sends &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests, so I care about &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; methods. In &lt;code&gt;command_hello_world&lt;/code&gt;, we send a call to the command worker thread, telling it to call &lt;code&gt;hello_world&lt;/code&gt; and then pass the &lt;code&gt;response_url&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter. The function immediately returns a response to Slack telling the user to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;hello_world&lt;/code&gt;, the function sleeps for a few seconds before sending a response back to the passed &lt;code&gt;response_url&lt;/code&gt;. This &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; is to emulate "real work" being done. In my case, it's five seconds of queries to JIRA to gather and format all of the data I want to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this can run locally by firing up Flask. I tested with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;FLASK_APP=jira-slack-integration.py flask run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deploying to Google App Engine, the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function won't be utilized. I cover that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="testing-the-application"&gt;Testing the application&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#testing-the-application" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time for everyone's favorite part of development: TESTING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="slack-set-up-part-1"&gt;Slack set up - Part 1&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#slack-set-up-part-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test a Slack application, though, some set up within Slack is needed: create a Slack Application, set up and gather tokens, and set up slash command end points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, create a &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1"&gt;new Slack App&lt;/a&gt;. Fill out the name and select the appropriate workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After submission, it redirects to a basic information section about the new application. Scroll down to "App Credentials". Copy the &lt;code&gt;Verification Token&lt;/code&gt; and put it in the &lt;code&gt;SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; variable in the Flask application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Slack in the browser, sign in, and then open the web console. In Chrome, do this with &lt;kbd class="light"&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;SHIFT&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;I&lt;/kbd&gt; or with &lt;kbd class="light"&gt;F12&lt;/kbd&gt; in FireFox. View the page source and search for &lt;code&gt;team_id&lt;/code&gt;. It will look something like this: &lt;code&gt;"T083XXXX"&lt;/code&gt;. Copy this value to &lt;code&gt;SLACK_TEAM_ID&lt;/code&gt; in the Flask application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ngrok-set-up"&gt;ngrok set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#ngrok-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before slash commands can be set up in Slack, you need a development environment and an easy way to access our development server. One option is to punch holes in the router's firewall to point to your development machine. This works if you are on a home network and you'll be the only machine running the development server. It's no so easy if your set up is more complicated or infrastructure is outside of your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose to use &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/"&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt; instead. This application provides you with a free, secure and public URL to your local development environment without worrying about your NAT or firewall settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up. After that the four steps to complete setup are shown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download ngrok. There are downloads for a variety of operating systems. This includes Ubuntu, which I use for my work related development work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unzip ngrok to any location: &lt;code&gt;unzip /path/to/ngrok.zip&lt;/code&gt; This places an &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; binary in the selected location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the authentication token. This is a one time step. This will create a &lt;code&gt;~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;. If you're using the script from above, Flask should run on the local machine on port 5000. The command to start &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; to point to the Flask server is: &lt;code&gt;./ngrok http 5000&lt;/code&gt;. In another command prompt start the Flask application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="slack-set-up-part-2"&gt;Slack set up - Part 2&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#slack-set-up-part-2" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; provides a public URL. In the screenshot below, my URL is &lt;code&gt;https://1eed8eae.ngrok.io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ngrok dashboard" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/ngrok.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This changes every time &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; is stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I can visit &lt;code&gt;https://1eed8eae.ngrok.io/hello-world&lt;/code&gt; in my browser and get an error message because I didn't configure it to support &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to Slack and the management area where the new application was set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "Slash Commands"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "Create New Command"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put in the command users will use within Slack. This can be anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the request URL. This will be &lt;code&gt;https://1eed8eae.ngrok.io/hello-world&lt;/code&gt; with this example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a description of the command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a usage hint. This is useful if you are passing parameters to the command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Slash Command Example" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/slash-command-example.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slash command is now set up. The last step is installing the application. Go back to "Basic Information" and expand "Install your app to your workspace" then press the green "Install App to Workspace" button. You'll be presented with an oAuth Access Token. For this example application, it's not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go into any channel in Slack and use the new &lt;code&gt;/hello-world&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If/when you shut down and restart &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;, you'll get a new end point. The slash command will need to be modified to point to this new request URL to continue to function. These changes will not be required once the application is deployed to Google's App Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="deploy-application-to-app-engine"&gt;Deploy application to App Engine&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#deploy-application-to-app-engine" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project requires the use of the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/the-appengine-environments"&gt;flexible app engine environment&lt;/a&gt; (vs. standard environment). The biggest reason for this is due to the network requirements. It seems that anything other than Node.js has networking restrictions, and the sample application needs to connect to Slack and my application also needed to connect to JIRA. Another downside of the standard environment is that it only supports Python 2.7. I don't believe there is anything in the example application that would break on Python 2, but there are a few Python 3 specific things I used in my real application (f strings, are one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flexible environment isn't free though. It's always on. The sample application and my real application are so small and used by so few people that it costs less than fifty cents a day. This isn't a huge deal when the rest of our Google cloud bill exceeds that by a couple orders of magnitude, but it is something to consider if you are just running this as a small side thing. It's not free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="set-up-gcloud-sdk"&gt;Set up gcloud SDK&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up-gcloud-sdk" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the size of this application, the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/"&gt;quick start tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that Google provides is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Google Cloud Platform console, create a new App Engine project and enable billing (billing must be enabled). This can be done from &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/appengine/create?lang=flex_python&amp;amp;st=true"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/"&gt;Google Cloud SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract this to any location. To add it to the path, run &lt;code&gt;./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh&lt;/code&gt;. If this isn't done, the full path needs to be in all &lt;code&gt;gcloud&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize the SDK by running &lt;code&gt;gcloud init&lt;/code&gt; and follow the prompts on screen. You'll need access to a browser for this step as you'll be authorizing your account using oAuth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="set-up-appyaml"&gt;Set up app.yaml&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up-appyaml" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;gcloud&lt;/code&gt; set up on your development machine, there is one last step to do: Configuring the &lt;code&gt;app.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file contains information on the type of environment you'll be deploying to. Create and save an &lt;code&gt;app.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file in the same directory as the Flask application. For this example, the Flask application is in a file saved as &lt;code&gt;example-script.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;entrypoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gunicorn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;$PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;runtime_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;manual_scaling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;memory_gb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;disk_size_gb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the &lt;code&gt;entrypoint&lt;/code&gt; line, this is the example &lt;code&gt;app.yaml&lt;/code&gt; provided by Google. &lt;code&gt;example-script&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the file that contains the Flask application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="deploy-to-google"&gt;Deploy to Google&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#deploy-to-google" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's time to deploy this application to Google. From within the same directory where &lt;code&gt;example-script.py&lt;/code&gt; resides, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcloud app deploy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a few minutes for the deployment to occur. When it's complete, the command prompt will say so and provide a URL where the application is accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing that needs to be done, is repointing the slash commands to this new location. With it deployed to Google's Cloud Platform, the &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; provided URLs need to be changed. The endpoints remain the same though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the slash commands are changed and saved, test them out and enjoy the new slash commands hosted on Google's App Engine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Set up Dynamic CloudFlare IP with Let's Encrypt</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/setup-lets-encrypt.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-04-25T09:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-04-25T09:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-04-25:/setup-lets-encrypt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time to make the server accessible from the internet and secure it with an SSL certificate&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two previous articles, I installed &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-nextcloud.html"&gt;NextCloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. These are running on the server, inside my local network, with
no firewall rules set up to allow it to be accessible from the internet. That's great if I plan on sitting at home all the time and never
accessing anything from the outside. However, I do plan on that. That means I need to make this server accessible from the internet. On top
of that, I want to secure the connection to the server with SSL, so that I'm not uploading pictures or code in a way that everyone can read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-cloudflare"&gt;Setting up CloudFlare&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-cloudflare" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new server sits in my house, which sits on a residential ISP network. Obviously, this isn't going to have 24x7 uptime, but that's fine
with me. One thing that I will need, is a way to access this server regardless of the IP address my ISP has given me. This can (and does) change
frequently enough that it'd be annoying to keep track of my current IP manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution: set up a DNS entry. In the two previous articles, I set up the Apache virtual hosts with subdomains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;ServerName nas.example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;ServerName gitlab.example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to utilize those. Then I will only need to visit those URLs and Apache will handle routing to the correct application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use CloudFlare to handle DNS for this blog. I described the process to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html"&gt;set up CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago and never
looked at it again. "It just works." Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, we're going to add two new A entries to reflect the subdomains I want to use. I'll point it at my IP address initially too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="automating-the-ip-adddress-updates"&gt;Automating the IP adddress updates&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#automating-the-ip-adddress-updates" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial set up of the A entry/IP address takes a minute. The trick is automating that process every time your IP address changes. I
am doing that with a small Python script called &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ethaligan/cloudflare-ddns"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cloudflare-ddns&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Clone this to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/ethaligan/cloudflare-ddns.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to set up zone information. This is the configuration file that will be used to update your A records. Copy example.com.yml to the
name of your domain. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd zones
cp example.com.yml andrewwegner.com.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to edit the newly copied file to contain appropriate zone information, CloudFlare API information and your domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cf_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;your_cloudflare_email_address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-Cloudflare-API-key&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;If&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ddns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cf_zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;records&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;If&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;its&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'@'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subdomain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ddns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ddns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cf_records&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ERROR&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;discover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;faster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;may&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;system&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cf_resolving_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I am updating two subdomains (&lt;code&gt;nas&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gitlab&lt;/code&gt;) that are part of the &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; domain. Those should be changed to reflect your set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, we need to schedule this to run on a regular basis so that CloudFlare always points to the correct IP address. I did this with a crontab entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/30 &lt;span class="gs"&gt;* *&lt;/span&gt; * * python3 /path/to/cloudflare-ddns.py -z example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, change &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; to your domain, and it will use the appropriate YML file. With this entry, my DNS entries are updated every 30 minutes. That
is frequently enough for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lets-encrypt-ssl"&gt;Let's Encrypt (SSL)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#lets-encrypt-ssl" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the subdomains set up and working, it's time to install some SSL certificates. In previous articles, I had entries in my Apache virtual hosts that pointed to
SSL certificates. This is where we'll set those up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Renewing certificates, though, can be easily automated. Since I need my certificates to work through CloudFlare,
because it provides my DNS services, I use a hook in Let's Encrypt's ACME client &lt;a href="https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dehydrated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to handle everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
cd dehydrated
mkdir hooks
git clone https://github.com/kappataumu/letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook hooks/cloudflare
pip install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This downloads deydrated and then downloads the CloudFlare hook that is needed. It installs the required libraries too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last bit of configuration that is needed is setting up a &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;dehydrated&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano dehydrated/config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following three lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CF_EMAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_EMAILADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CF_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CF_DEBUG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute your CloudFlare login email and API key as appropriate. The &lt;code&gt;CF_DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; line can be set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; if you don't wish debugging information to be printed to &lt;code&gt;logs/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Register with Let's Encrypt and accept their terms of service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;terms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you're ready to generate/install the SSL certificates needed. One note: I needed to adjust the shebang line in hooks/cloudflare/hook.py to be &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands to generate the certificates. These will end up in &lt;code&gt;dehydrated/certs&lt;/code&gt; with the full URL of each certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;./dehydrated -c -d nas.example.com -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/cloudflare/hook.py'
./dehydrated -c -d gitlab.example.com -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/cloudflare/hook.py'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path to these files are what will go in your Apache Virtual Host files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;SSLCertificateFile /path/to/dehydrated/certs/nas.example.com/cert.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/dehydrated/certs/nas.example.com/privkey.pem
SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/dehydrated/certs/nas.example.com/chain.pem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up a crontab entry for each of my subdomains to attempt to renew the certificate once a week. Dehydrated will not attempt to renew a certificate if it's not going to
expire in less than 30 days, so we aren't making unneeded calls to Let's Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hooks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cloudflare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hooks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cloudflare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this final step, I have a home server that I can access from anywhere. It allows me to backup pictures automatically, holds my private repositories and is protected
by SSL. The SSL certificates renew automatically.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Setting up GitLab on the new server</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/installing-gitlab.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-04-13T08:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-04-13T08:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-04-13:/installing-gitlab.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let's set up some private repositories on GitLab&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I ran Vipers, my fellow admins and I hosted a small set of code repositories -
SVN, Mercurial and Git - to host some of our custom code. We ran &lt;a href="https://rhodecode.com/"&gt;RhodeCode&lt;/a&gt; and
the fork, &lt;a href="https://kallithea-scm.org/"&gt;Kallithea&lt;/a&gt;, when RhodeCode close sourced some of it's code and
couldn't figure out if the license it used actually allowed themselves to do that. A private
repository was awesome for plugins, server configurations and personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the community was shuttered, some of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins"&gt;plugin code was migrated to GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and it's
sat there untouched since. My personal projects were either migrated to GitHub or
simply stored outside of version control if it couldn't go in a public repository. That was
less than ideal, but it worked. With the new home server set up, I wanted to get source control set
back up for my non-public personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rejected RhodeCode right away due to the experiences I had when they changed licenses. Turns out,
they had done it again in the meantime. I didn't want to deal with that. I attempted to install
Kallithea using their &lt;a href="http://kallithea.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;, but I kept running into Python syntax errors. It wasn't
worth the time and effort to figure out the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I turned to &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. It'd definitely overkill for what I really need, but it works and
if I ever truly decide to get fancy, I have a lot of other tools I can use. The &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/self-hosted/feature-comparison/"&gt;core&lt;/a&gt; functionality
is what I'll be using and is free. The three other versions cost some money and contain features that
would be useful for large team, not a single developer or very small team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dependencies"&gt;Dependencies&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing GitLab is pretty simple. There are a couple dependencies needed, but I already had both OpenSSH 
and Postfix installed, so I was able to skip the first step in the &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/installation/#ubuntu"&gt;official installation guide&lt;/a&gt;. I installed
the Ubuntu Omnibus package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates postfix
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="getting-the-package"&gt;Getting the package&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-the-package" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GitLab repository needs to added and then installed. To add the repository, issue this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the GitLab package, you need to provide an environment variable when you issue your
&lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; command. This will be the URL where you want to access your GitLab installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo EXTERNAL_URL="http://gitlab.example.com" apt-get install gitlab-ee
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="complete-the-installation"&gt;Complete the installation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#complete-the-installation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the install, above is complete, you need to log in to complete the process. In your browser,
navigate to the URL you provided above. Set/reset the password as prompted and then login. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="post-install-tweaks"&gt;Post-install Tweaks&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#post-install-tweaks" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="using-apache-instead-of-nginx"&gt;Using Apache instead of Nginx&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#using-apache-instead-of-nginx" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The omnibus package comes with Nginx bundled. Unfortunately, I don't have any experience managing
an Nginx instance but do have experience with Apache. I want to use something that I know to make
my life easier. Fortunately, GitLab can handle this with a few &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/tree/master/web-server/apache"&gt;minor changes to the configuration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb&lt;/code&gt; file you'll need to make several settings changes. You also need Apache 
already installed and the &lt;code&gt;www-data&lt;/code&gt; user (on Ubuntu) added to the &lt;code&gt;gitlab-www&lt;/code&gt; group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find &lt;code&gt;nginx['enable']&lt;/code&gt; and set it to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;web_server['external_users']&lt;/code&gt;, add &lt;code&gt;www-data&lt;/code&gt; to the array. Note that this is an array and not a single string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;gitlab_rails['trusted_proxies']&lt;/code&gt;, add the IP address of the Apache web server. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the gitlab workhorse settings to the following (default) values. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may already be in the configuration file. If so, you probably don't need to modify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gitlab_workhorse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen_network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tcp"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gitlab_workhorse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"127.0.0.1:8181"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, run &lt;code&gt;sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure&lt;/code&gt; for the settings to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you need to configure Apache's virtual host. GitLab provides &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/tree/master/web-server/apache"&gt;example virtual hosts&lt;/a&gt;. Since I installed
the omnibus package and am using Apache 2.4, I selected the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/blob/master/web-server/apache/gitlab-omnibus-apache24.conf"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gitlab-omnibus-apache24.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file. Adjust all
instances of &lt;code&gt;YOUR_SERVER_FQDN&lt;/code&gt; to the fully qualified domain name of your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will go in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available/&lt;/code&gt; and a symlink in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/&lt;/code&gt; will point to this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo touch /etc/apache2/sites-available/gitlab.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/gitlab.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/gitlab.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="use-ssl-to-access-gitlab"&gt;Use SSL to access GitLab&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#use-ssl-to-access-gitlab" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example virtual host provided by GitLab uses HTTP only. I want to set up my instance to use HTTPS. I'll be 
doing this with &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, like I did when I set up NextCloud in the previous post. I cover the exact 
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/setup-lets-encrypt.html"&gt;steps for Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; in another post. The keys referenced in the virtual host configuration file below created 
by that process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first change to make is to redirect the HTTP version of your domain to HTTPS. The goal is that all traffic to
GitLab will go over SSL. Adjust the &lt;code&gt;ServerName&lt;/code&gt; variable as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;*:80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;ServerName&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;gitlab.example.com
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;ServerSignature&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Off

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;RewriteEngine&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;on
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;RewriteCond&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;%{HTTPS}&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;!=on
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;RewriteRule&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.*&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI}&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;[NE,R,L]
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, everything in the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/blob/master/web-server/apache/gitlab-omnibus-apache24.conf"&gt;sample&lt;/a&gt; virtual host file can be put in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:443&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of this block, we need to reference the Let's Encrypt keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;SSLProtocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-SSLv2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;SSLCertificateChainFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;certs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;gitlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;chain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;pem&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and restart Apache. You should be automatically redirected over HTTPS when you visit your GitLab URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="allow-spaces-in-repository-names"&gt;Allow spaces in repository names&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#allow-spaces-in-repository-names" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the only problems I ran into with GitLab is that, by default, repositories with spaces in them can't be viewed
in the web browser. It throws a &lt;code&gt;400 Bad Request&lt;/code&gt; when trying to view the directory. There is a &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18213"&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; 
regarding this problem. The developers are working on updating the samples in a way that is guaranteed to work through
the whole system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, though, the first comment which suggests a minor &lt;code&gt;RewireRule&lt;/code&gt; change works great. In the virtual host, fine the line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteRule .* http://127.0.0.1:8181%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,NE]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and remove the &lt;code&gt;NE&lt;/code&gt; so that it reads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteRule .* http://127.0.0.1:8181%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart Apache and you can navigate to the directory with a space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="setting-up-smtp"&gt;Setting up SMTP&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-smtp" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab can send out emails and requires the ability to do so when resetting a password, at minimum. I don't want this
email to be marked as spam, so I used one of the free providers from &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/smtp.html#smtp-settings"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and set up an account. After editing the 
&lt;code&gt;/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb&lt;/code&gt; file to match the provider I selected, I ran &lt;code&gt;gitlab-ctl reconfigure&lt;/code&gt;. Now any emails GitLab
sends out goes through the trusted email provider instead of coming directly from my residential IP address. This means 
my mail provider trusts it. I also send out less than 5 emails a month currently, so I am &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; below the tier where I
lose my "free" status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, GitLab is set up over SSL on my server. I can log in and start setting up repositories. Migrating and importing 
the code bases I didn't want to put on a public GitHub account was very satisfying. Maybe I'll look into some of the 
more advanced features GitLab offers in the near future, but for the time being I'm happy with what I have and the 
knowledge that I can expand what I do with GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="gitlab"/></entry><entry><title>Travis CI doesn't keep your environment variable secure</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-04-02T12:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-04-02T12:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-04-02:/travisci-insecure-environment-variables.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Travis CI does not keep your environment variables secure if you transfer a repository.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 27, 2017 I reported a security issue directly to the security team as their &lt;a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt; recommends. I received an automated response that a human would
follow up with me soon. It was their end of year, two week vacation (which is awesome!). I sent the same email again on January 26, 2018 and received a response back from AJ Bowen, a Build Infrastructure Engineer at Travis CI on January 29, 2018. They'd created an internal issue to track the behavior and would follow up within two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed up with AJ on February 28, 2018 and didn't receive a response. We're now over three months since my initial report. I believe it's time to make this more public so
that others know to be careful with their Travis CI managed environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-issue"&gt;The Issue&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-issue" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;Travis CI &lt;/a&gt; is an application that allows you to automatically test and deploy applications after a commit is pushed to GitHub. I've used this ability to run unit tests,
&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/my-experiences-releasing-a-package-to-pypi.html"&gt;automatically deploy updates to PyPI&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently when testing deployment to AWS using the Serverless framework. It's that last one that led me to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of deploying to AWS requires that you have credentials to deploy. I didn't want to put my AWS deploy credentials in GitHub, even if they are &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypting-environment-variables"&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt;. Instead,
I decided to set my variables in the &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings"&gt;Travis CI Settings&lt;/a&gt;. I went forward with my testing, watched the deploys happen as expected and eventually needed to transfer my
repository to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used GitHub to transfer the repository to the new owner. We tested a build and watched it deploy. The Travis CI console showed a successful deploy. The problem is,
it deployed to &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; AWS account using &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; AWS credentials. These "secure" environment variables had been transferred to a third party and were no longer in my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reproduction-short-version"&gt;Reproduction - Short Version&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reproduction-short-version" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reproducing the issue is trivial. The short version is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one GitHub account, create a repository with a &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Travis CI account associated with step 1, set up an environment variable and elect &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to show the value in the build log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer the GitHub repository to another account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the environment variables defined in step 2 are accessible by the new owner from step 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reproduction-long-version"&gt;Reproduction - Long Version&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reproduction-long-version" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed steps taken to reproduce this issue show that Travis CI is simply looking for the environment variable values and scrubbing those from the build logs. Once transferred, an edit can be introduced to show these variables with minimal work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-a-repository"&gt;Create a repository&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-repository" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new repository and add something. For this test, I created a simple Python Hello World file, and named it &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;print("Hello World")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit this change to your new repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="enable-travis-ci-integration"&gt;Enable Travis CI integration&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#enable-travis-ci-integration" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; and log in with the GitHub account associated with the above step. Sync your account. Then enable integration by changing the repository switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Enable Integration" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/1-travis-enable-repository.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-a-travisyml-file"&gt;Create a .travis.yml file&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-travisyml-file" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the integration now in place, set up a basic build script by adding a &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"3.5"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script will set up a build task and run your &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; file, using Python 3.5. You will see that "Hello World!" is printed in the build console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First Build" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2-travis-first-build.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="add-environment-variables"&gt;Add Environment Variables&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#add-environment-variables" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that our build script is working, we can work on "deployment". Deployment to AWS (or other cloud services) requires that you provide credentials. I am not a fan of
including credentials in my repository, even if they are encrypted. Opting for an environment variable should be more secure, as the credentials are never in your repository
in the first place. &lt;strong&gt;It is important to note that you are still giving your credentials to Travis CI in this case.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up environment variables, click on "More Options" and "Settings" within the Travis CI application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Travis Settings" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/3-add-variable-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now scroll down to "Environment Variables". Add the name of the variable and the value. Be sure to leave the default value of "Off" selected. You don't want to display this
value in the build log. Finally click "Add".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding a variable" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/4-add-variable-2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've added a second variable for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding a second variable" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/5-add-variable-3.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that variable values are hidden from view after clicking "Add".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Variable values hidden" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/6-variables-added.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="check-values-during-build"&gt;Check values during build&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#check-values-during-build" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the variables saved, restart your build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Restart Build" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/7-restart-build.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the build has completed, check the build log. Even though we aren't using these values yet, we can see the environment variables exist and are "Secure".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='"Secure" Variables' src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/8-variables-secure.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="accessing-the-values"&gt;Accessing the values&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-the-values" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These values are not actually secure. Travis CI is filtering for the values of these environment variables and if the specific string is found, it is scrubbed from
the log. We can see this with a small change to &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello World!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AWS KEY ID: |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;|"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AWS SECRET KEY: |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;|"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aws_secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we are splitting the values of the environment variables in half. For the &lt;code&gt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&lt;/code&gt; value, you smash these two together. This will match the
environment variable value, and will not be shown because the pattern still matches the value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;|{}{}|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, we split the two halves with a space and print it out. This will be shown, because the extra space no longer matches the exact value of the
environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;|{} {}|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit and push the change to GitHub. In Travis CI, we see the following in the build log:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Accessing the values" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/9-variables-filtered-by-match.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the first pattern is hidden because it matches the environment variable. The second pattern is shown, because the space in the middle means the pattern no longer
matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="transfer-the-repository"&gt;Transfer the repository&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#transfer-the-repository" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've shown the variables are accessible, it's time to transfer the repository to a new owner. In GitHub, this can be accomplished by going to the repository settings
and going down to the red "danger area". Once you've entered the name of the current repository and the name of the new owner, we wait for the new owner to accept the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Transfer the repository" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/10-transfer-repository.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="build-with-the-new-owner"&gt;Build with the new owner&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#build-with-the-new-owner" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a change and commit it to the new repository. I simply modified the "Hello World" line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;print("Hello World from new owner!")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new build will kick off. You can see that the repository has transferred to the new owner in the build log. You can also see the environment variables were transfered to the
new owner. Other than the new owner being listed, the build log shows the same output as before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Everything has transfered" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/11-build-after-transfer.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="variables-in-the-ui"&gt;Variables in the UI&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#variables-in-the-ui" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see these variables have transferred by going back to "More Options", then "Settings" in Travis CI. The values are still hidden behind the input password field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Variables in UI" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/12-variables-transfered.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="impact-of-bug"&gt;Impact of bug&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#impact-of-bug" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example above shows two problems. The bigger problem, in my opinion, is that environment variables are transferred to a new owner. The secondary problem is that "secure"
variables are really just obfuscated. Accessing them is trivial. With this demonstration, we added in a step to show that the variables can be seen by the original
owner. However, it is just as likely that the new owner could introduce such a change after the repository is transferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug requires the owner of the repository to perform the "dangerous" GitHub action of transferring a repository. That means it's impact is limited. However, it's just as
likely that the original owner has forgotten that environment variables were set up in Travis CI, an entirely separate system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a GitHub repository is transferred to a new owner, the environment variables in Travis CI should not travel with. This is especially true for the "secure" variables. I'd
rather that a build breaks after the transfer due to the lack of appropriate variables being set up than having my cloud credentials be sent to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mitigation"&gt;Mitigation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mitigation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitigation of this bug, until Travis CI stops transferring environment variables to new repository owners, requires the original owner to remove the variables prior to
transferring the repository. One of the steps that the owner should take is to log into Travis CI and ensure all secure variables have been removed from the Travis CI
environment. This will break the builds, but it will also ensure that private variables aren't leaked unintentionally to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="repository"&gt;Repository&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#repository" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository for testing is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/TravisIssue"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It's time to use all that storage space and install NextCloud.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last post, I described how I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/zfs-pool-on-ubuntu.html"&gt;set up ZFS on the new server&lt;/a&gt;. With a newly configured operating system and tons of space, it's time to start using it. One of the goals
I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/new-house-server.html"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; when I set up this server was the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back up data from all devices in the house automatically. As camera phones have gotten better, we've found that we carry our bulky digital camera less and less. The problem
 with the phone camera is that we need to get the pictures to the computer. I don't want to hunt down a data cable or email the pictures to myself. I'm also not a fan of
 posting everything to social media. I want my phone to send the pictures to a backup location automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to accomplish that by hosting an instance of &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/"&gt;NextCloud&lt;/a&gt; on this new server. Fortunately, the install process is pretty simple for this one. NextCloud provides
&lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/install/"&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;. When I installed it in mid-February 2018, it was on version 12.x. As of this post, in late March 2018, it's on version 13.x. I'll cover install
and upgrade processes in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prerequisites"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For NextCloud you'll need either MySQL or MariaDB. I host it via Apache2, so we'll have that installed too. NextCloud is written in PHP, meaning we need that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install apache2 mariadb-server php7.0 libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0-mbstring php7.0-curl php7.0-zip php7.0-gd php7.0-mysql php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-bcmath php7.0-xml php7.0-json php7.0-tidy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable the Apache2 rewrite module and restart the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo service apache2 restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="set-up-the-database"&gt;Set up the database&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up-the-database" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to create a database for NextCloud. Log into your database using credentials that can create new users and databases. &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql -uroot -p
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, execute a couple SQL statements to create a database and create a user that can access the database. Make sure you use a secure password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextclouduser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURSECUREPASSWORDHERE';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
\q
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="download-nextcloud"&gt;Download NextCloud&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#download-nextcloud" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, I initially installed version 12 of NextCloud. The latest version can be found on the &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/install/"&gt;NextCloud install page&lt;/a&gt;. The URL from that page should be
used instead of the version 12 link in the following code block. The code block below will be putting NextCloud in the default location Ubuntu has Apache look. You can modify
that as needed. If you do so, the virtual host will need to be modified slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nextcloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;releases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nextcloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;12.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unzip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nextcloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;12.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nextcloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;www&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to adjust ownership of the files so that Apache can read them. The default user and group, in this case is &lt;code&gt;www-data&lt;/code&gt;. If you have configured your server to use a
different user or group, adjust this command accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;www&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;www&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;www&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nextcloud&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-the-virtual-host"&gt;Create the Virtual Host&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#create-the-virtual-host" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be exposing this to the internet and I'll be accessing it via the internet. That means I really don't want to send data unencrypted to or from NextCloud. I'll be setting
up the standard port 80 web server traffic to redirect to the secure port of 443. I cover &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/setup-lets-encrypt.html"&gt;generating SSL certificates&lt;/a&gt; in another post. I use &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. The keys
referenced in the virtual host configuration file below created by that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new virtual host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo touch /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/nextcloud.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you need to edit this newly created file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paste the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;*:80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Options&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;FollowSymLinks
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;AllowOverride&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;All
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Order&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;allow,deny
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;allow&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;all
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ErrorLog&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/log/apache2/nas.example.com-error_log
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;CustomLog&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/log/apache2/nas.example.com-access_log&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;common
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two separate virtual host configurations being created here. The first one, on port 80, is setting up the permanent redirect to the HTTPS site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the secure virtual host configuration, we're setting a small rewrite rule to provide nicer URLs and configuring the SSL certificates to use. The &lt;code&gt;DocumentRoot&lt;/code&gt; variables
should match the path you installed NextCloud into in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="application-configuration"&gt;Application Configuration&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#application-configuration" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few settings that you need to change in the NextCloud configuration. Do this by editing &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config.php&lt;/code&gt;. If this file doesn't exist,
you need to copy &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config.sample.php&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config.php&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important settings to check are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n n-Quoted"&gt;`datadirectory`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pointed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ZFS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n n-Quoted"&gt;`overwrite.cli.url`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Changed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="complete-the-installation"&gt;Complete the installation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#complete-the-installation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart Apache and the navigate to the domain you've set up for your NextCloud installation. I am assuming that you know how to set up a DNS record for the server name
you specified in your virtual host configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've reached the domain in your web browser, follow the instructions on screen. You'll need the database username and password you created above. You'll also create an
administration user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upgrading"&gt;Upgrading&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time, NextCloud will update. You should apply these updates, as they'll include new features and security patches. Log into NextCloud using your administration user.
Click on the Gear icon in the upper right and pick "Settings". On the left hand side, select "Basic settings". Half way down the page you'll see the version you are currently
running and whether or not there is an update available. If there is, you can begin the update from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextCloud does not support skipping versions when updating. This means if you are on version 12, you can upgrade to version 13. You can not, however, upgrade directly from 12 to 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a very minor hiccup when I upgraded the underlying PHP version. I covered that process in a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/updating-php-ubuntu-1804.html"&gt;later post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="syncing-data"&gt;Syncing data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#syncing-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextCloud provides client applications that allow you to automatically sync data to your install. There are clients for both computers and mobile devices. My use case only
requires the mobile clients right now, but that may change in the future. From the &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/install/"&gt;install page&lt;/a&gt;, you can find the clients for Android, iOS and Windows devices. Select
the appropriate installer on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the mobile client is installed, you need to provide the URL to your installation and a username and password that can access your information. I've enabled automatic
uploads of new pictures from my devices only when I'm on a wireless connection (no sense wasting mobile data). This, however, is why I wanted the SSL certificates. The client
doesn't let me whitelist uploading from specific networks. I'd prefer I don't send my pictures unencrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using NextCloud for almost three months so far. I love it. Previously, I'd have to find a data cable and remember to manually backup my pictures once and a while. Now,
it "just happens". If I take a picture at home, it's backed up within seconds. If I take a bunch of pictures while I'm out of the house, my pictures are backed up within
minutes of me getting home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's Django Course from Basics to Advance</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/django-course-basic-to-advance.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-02-20T22:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-02-20T22:45:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-02-20:/django-course-basic-to-advance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Django Course from Basics to Advance course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; This course has been removed from Udemy. Read the review below to find out how bad it was and why I got a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/new-house-server.html"&gt;new server&lt;/a&gt; coming along nicely, I wanted to take a quick refresher on Django. Last summer I went through another &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/django-fullstack-bootcamp-course-review.html"&gt;Django course&lt;/a&gt;. That
was a decent course. I didn't need anything that intensive or that focused on the non-Django portions though. I have a couple plans for web control panels
that will help me manage the aspects of the new server I care most about. I decided to take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/django-course-from-basics-to-advance/"&gt;Django Course from Basics to Advance&lt;/a&gt; by Bucky Roberts.
It is billed as a five hour course and seemed to hit major aspects of the framework. It was released in January 2018, so it was brand new at the time I signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: &lt;em&gt;Avoid this course&lt;/em&gt;. It's a waste of money. The bad grammar in the title should have been the red flag that made me avoid it. Unfortunately, that was
only the start of my issues with the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-course"&gt;Thoughts on the course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally ten seconds into the first lecture: "If you guys were wondering what the F Django is, it's not a movie, well it is a movie." It only goes
down hill from there. A few complaints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A majority of the lectures start with "Alright Hauses"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Think of [Django] like PHP, if you guys are fuzzy on it, but cooler."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 3 includes a rant about what an "app" is and how everyone is developing "apps" now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In lecture 10, the instructor starts with a rant about an overweight airline passenger sitting next to them on a plane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insults and mocking of front end developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the lectures ends with "To be honest, my mom keeps texting me and it's kind of annoying."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another lecture is interrupted with this train of thought: "There is a dog barking outside. It's annoying me."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, one lecture ends with "Thank you guys for watching. Don't forget to subscribe!"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a YouTube channel. The instructor uploaded their YouTube channel to Udemy. Not only that, they uploaded two year old tutorial videos. It's not
even current!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are technical issues with the course too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructor is using Django 1.9. There is three years out of date at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation instructions tell users to use administration or &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; rights for all Python libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation instructions are done using &lt;code&gt;easy_install&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;urls.py&lt;/code&gt; files that define URL routes, there are lines that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor attempts to describe the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in front of &lt;code&gt;'^admin/'&lt;/code&gt; by saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I type "r", it means 'regular expression'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just flat wrong. &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; indicates a &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals"&gt;raw string&lt;/a&gt;. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't waste your time with this. Don't look at it. Don't think about it. This course is a YouTube channel. If you really want to watch a two year old series running a
three year old version of Django &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&amp;amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK"&gt;watch it on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. It's not worth it. The information is outdated and wrong in many spots. The instructor uploaded this course for
a quick dollar. They didn't build this course for Udemy. They built it for YouTube and you can tell. The quality of content here is not what I've come to expect from
Udemy course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for me, Udemy Support was very helpful when I requested a refund. I listed most of the complaints I did above and mentioned it course was just a
YouTube channel that had been uploaded to Udemy. I was issued a refund in under an hour. I also left my first public review of a course on Udemy so that other students
know they can get the same content elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Course Review" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/django-course-basics-to-advance-review-screenshot.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want to find a quick refresher. I'll have to go hunting for that later.&lt;/p&gt;

This post covers setting up the ZFS pool for all the data&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/new-house-server.html"&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; in this series, the new NAS was assembled. Ubuntu 16.04 has been installed and updated. It's time to do something with all those hard drives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be setting the seven 4TB drives in a single &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS"&gt;ZFS&lt;/a&gt; pool. I'm using ZFS for protection against data corruption. It offers several other &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZFS"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; too. I'll
be using dual parity, which means I could lose two drives and be able to recover. The goal is never to test this, but I'd rather not go through a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/backup-your-data.html"&gt;data loss scare&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, it's a good idea to ensure Ubuntu has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the update complete, let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installing-zfs"&gt;Installing ZFS&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#installing-zfs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing the ZFS file system is simple on Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install zfs parted
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ta-da! Your system is now capable of setting up ZFS pools. The &lt;code&gt;parted&lt;/code&gt; package will be used to set up a ZFS pool shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-our-pool"&gt;Setting up our pool&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-our-pool" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools are the basic building block of ZFS. A pool is made up of the underlying devices that will store the data. Setting up our ZFS pool requires a little bit of prep work
for our new drives. First, ensure that the &lt;code&gt;zfs&lt;/code&gt; package installed correctly by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo zpool status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the process, you should get the message &lt;code&gt;no pools available&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adding-the-gpt-label"&gt;Adding the GPT label&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#adding-the-gpt-label" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm setting up this pool with brand new drives. We need to add a &lt;code&gt;GPT&lt;/code&gt; label to each disk so that ZFS doesn't complain about disks having an &lt;code&gt;invalid vdev specification&lt;/code&gt; 
when we create the pool. To do this, we'll find the names of our drives first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -l /dev/sd*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my system, I get a result similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,   0 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sda
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,   1 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sda1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,   2 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sda2
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,   5 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sda5
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  16 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sdb
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  32 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sdc
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  48 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sdd
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  64 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sde
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  80 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sdf
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  96 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sdg
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 112 Feb 13 09:23 /dev/sdh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be adding the &lt;code&gt;GPT&lt;/code&gt; labels to each of the unformatted drives. The unformatted ones are the listed drives that don't have a numeral as well. For me, that means we'll
be working with &lt;code&gt;sdb&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sdc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sdd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sde&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sdf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sdg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sdh&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;sda&lt;/code&gt; drive has been formatted and contains partitions already. Those are &lt;code&gt;sda1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sda2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sda5&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each drive, except &lt;code&gt;sda&lt;/code&gt; in my case, we need to run the &lt;code&gt;parted&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo parted /dev/sdb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will give you a short dialog. All you will need to do is issue the &lt;code&gt;mklabel GPT&lt;/code&gt; command and then quit (using &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;GNU Parted 3.2

&lt;h3 id="getting-device-ids"&gt;Getting device IDs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-device-ids" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;code&gt;GPT&lt;/code&gt; labels are added, we can create our pool. However, we're not going to use the device paths returned above. Theoretically, those can change (especially if you 
replace a drive). That would be bad and mess with the entire ZFS pool. Instead we're going to create the pool by using the device id. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This returns output similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;lrwxrwxrwx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Feb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;disk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WDC_WDS100T1B0A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H9H0_174256421671&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;part5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sda5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that both formats symlink to the same location. This means you can pick which ever format you like better. However, I recommend the second one that contains the 
device serial number. It'll make it easier to determine problem disks in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-the-pool"&gt;Create the pool&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#create-the-pool" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've determined the device ides for each of our hard drives, it's time to actually create the pool. As I mentioned above, we'll be creating using dual parity
(&lt;code&gt;raidz2&lt;/code&gt;). We'll be naming our pool &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. Once this command is complete, &lt;code&gt;/data&lt;/code&gt; will be where this pool resides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo zpool create data raidz2 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K0HLKUXT /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K0HLKXS0 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K6VNNTXY /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K6VNN6TA /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K5LCEYN4 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K4YJ6T0U /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K7TSA4VS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will take a little while, but a surprisingly smaller amount of time than I initially expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the creation is complete, take a look at the status of your new pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo zpool status

errors: No known data errors
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last line is important. No known data errors is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="create-datasets"&gt;Create datasets&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#create-datasets" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where pools are the basic building blocks of ZFS, datasets is a term for a ZFS file system, volume, snapshot or clone. Each dataset can be managed and configured differently.
This means that you can compress one dataset, but leave the others alone. You can put a quota on one, but leave the others without a quota. Creating a dataset is pretty easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /
sudo zfs create data/storage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a dataset that exists at &lt;code&gt;/data&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;storage&lt;/code&gt;. You can have child datasets that inherit attributes from parents (or even grandparents) by doing something
like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo zfs create data/storage/music
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create the new dataset at &lt;code&gt;/data/storage&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;music&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've set up your datasets, you can see they were all created and how much space they have available by issuing &lt;code&gt;sudo zfs list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-up-complete"&gt;Set up complete&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#set-up-complete" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, we've finished setting up ZFS on Ubuntu 16.04. I set up a few datasets for my purposes. I'm one step closer to getting this running and handling all of the 
digital data in the house. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>...and then there was a backup server</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/new-house-server.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-02-12T15:15:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-10T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-02-12:/new-house-server.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technical discussion about the new backup server&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/backup-your-data.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I covered the events that lead to my data loss scare. Faulty, untested, backups will bite you every time. The question 
is just, "when will it happen?". By mid-to-late January (three months later), I'd gotten everything back from SERT Data Recovery and
was happy that everything was recovered. It was time to finally build that huge NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="server-goals"&gt;Server Goals&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#server-goals" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NAS for a home backup solution could be something as simple as a prebuilt device with a couple hard drives. I'm a bit of a geek and have a lot of digital data, not to
mention family pictures, years worth of programs I've written, and a digital music and movie collection. I'm a digital pack rat, but a well organized digital pack rat.
I also wanted to get more out of this server than "plug the device into the router". I ran game servers for &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;Vipers&lt;/a&gt; for five years. I did a little bit of server
work at Caterpillar. I've toyed with server virtual machines off and on for testing various packages and software over the years. Through all of this, though, I've
never had a server in the house that I could use to run some of my scripts on. Those always ran on my desktop because it was always on. This server was going to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had several goals when building this thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have more storage space than I needed for several years. I didn't want to rebuild this in 18 months because I was bad at planning. Years ago when I built my computer
 for college, I stuck two 120 gigabyte hard drives in the machine and thought I'd never fill that. When I came home that first summer, I already had to upgrade hard drives
 because I was low on space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a server version of Linux. I don't want to buy a license for a Microsoft server product and my Microsoft Academic Licenses expired a while ago. During my time with Vipers, I used a Red Hat variant of Linux. At Caterpillar we used Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS"&gt;ZFS&lt;/a&gt; for protection against data corruption. This combined with my more recent usage of Ubuntu lead me to decide on using Ubuntu Server for the operating system.
 At the time of this post, I'll be using the 16.04 LTS version. I'll continue to upgrade to future LTS versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back up data from all devices in the house automatically. As camera phones have gotten better, we've found that we carry our bulky digital camera less and less. The problem
 with the phone camera is that we need to get the pictures to the computer. I don't want to hunt down a data cable or email the pictures to myself. I'm also not a fan of 
 posting everything to social media. I want my phone to send the pictures to a backup location automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host my personal git repositories and personal projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to stream music and movies to other devices on the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hardware"&gt;Hardware&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#hardware" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've decided my goals, it was time to pick out hardware. The biggest decision was to determine how much storage space I'd be getting. The idea was that hard drives
would be the majority of the cost of this machine. In the end, I went with the following hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rosewell 4U server chasis. It's rack mountable for the future when I can convince myself that a server rack in the basement is a thing I want to spend money on and haul around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supermicro MBD-X11SSM-F-O Micro AT server motherboard (LGA 1151)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel Xeon E3-1230 V5 3.4 Ghz processor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x Supermicro certified MEM-DR416L-SL01-EU21 16 GB DDR4-2133 ECC server memory. Take careful note of that model. I originally ordered MEM-DR416L-SL01-ER21 (notice 
 the single "R" to "U" character difference). The motherboard did not like the ER21 at all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVGA 650 power supply (I've been really happy with EVGA power supplies on my last 4 machine builds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Western Digital Blue 1 terabyte SSD (for the operating system and other applications)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7x Western Digital Red 4 terabyte hard drives (for all the data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enough SATA cables for all 8 drives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be running ZFS in RAIDZ2 (dual parity). This means with 7 drives, two will be effectively parity drives. I'll have a total of 20 terabytes, minus formatting, for data. After formatting this comes down to a little over 16 terabytes of usable space. Considering that the rest of the household has a combined 5 terabytes, if I use up every available bit, I'm hoping that 16 will last me a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="that-ram"&gt;That RAM...&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#that-ram" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with the Supermicro board based on a recommendation from a friend. Supermicro's site is really good. It has &lt;a href="https://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C236_C232/X11SSM-F.cfm"&gt;tested compatible hardware lists&lt;/a&gt; and, it turns out, 
a knowledgeable person behind their online store's chat feature. The problem that I ran into when building this machine is that the compatible RAM was really hard to find. 
I didn't realize that and ordered the mother board in my first batch of components. When I finally went to look for RAM, I failed to notice a single character difference between
the EU21 version that I needed and the ER21 version that I ordered first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assembled the machine, plugged everything in, and turned on the new server. Then it beeped at me. A lot. After some troubleshooting, re-seating the RAM and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;
 realizing that I ordered the wrong stuff, I exchanged what I ordered with what I needed. The EU21 RAM worked perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware is assembled. Ubuntu 16.04 Server has been installed. The next step is configuring the server to be the backup solution for the entire house and meeting my other 
goals. I'll have a few more posts in this series on how I accomplished those goals. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: The link to SERT Data Recovery was removed in March of 2023 because it failed multiple link checks with multiple errors. While I am still very happy with the work they performed in 2018, as of 2023 I don't feel comfortable linking to a site that continues to fail basic SSL certificate checks and forces browsers to warn users against visiting the site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Well, there goes my data...</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/backup-your-data.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-01-27T00:04:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-10T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2018-01-27:/backup-your-data.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learn from my mistake and test your backups&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 2017 started nicely. The weather was still good. Fall hadn't really arrived yet, though I was still raking some leaves. Halloween was approaching and
soccer season had just ended so I had time of weekends to do a few more projects. Then in mid-October one of my hard drives died. It was sudden. There were
no SMART warnings. There wasn't any weird sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the only indication that there was a problem initially was that one of my running applications couldn't access a log file. I didn't think any of it.
I took a few minutes to install a Windows update that had been nagging me for a day or so and rebooted the machine. A reboot on my desktop normally takes twenty-ish
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the reboot stretched into the fifth minute, I realized there was a problem. However, I was initially getting ready to blame that Windows update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-data-disaster"&gt;A Data Disaster&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-data-disaster" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the reboot finished and I logged into the machine. Immediately, I received alerts that files couldn't be accessed and programs couldn't start. I tried to launch
Firefox and was told it couldn't be found. "Well, this is bad," I thought. Turns out that was an understatement. After a short investigation, I found that one of my hard drives wasn't being detected by Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my desktop, I have three hard drives. The first is, a decently sided solid state machine that hosts the operating system. The second is a large solid state drive that
holds my game installs. The third is a large spinning hard drive (Seagate), which is where I install software and hold my data. The missing drive was the large one that holds
my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic set in. However, I had just backed stuff up to my trusty external hard drive. "At most I'll lose a week's worth of stuff. And, I still have the pictures on phones and
camera SD cards," I said, trying to comfort myself. I also new I had at least two brand new and unused drives identical to the one that had just had a problem. Those were the
result of cheap hard drives when I build my desktop and the promise that one day I'd build a true backup solution for the house. Yeah, hadn't done that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After messing with the missing drive by unplugging it and rebooting (bringing back normal boot times), swapping it to another SATA port ("hey, maybe it's the motherboard"),
trying to access it in a Linux LiveCD and plugging it into an external drive, I concluded that it was dead. I pulled it from the desktop, resisted smashing it to pieces in
frustration and plugged one of it's unused siblings in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows booted right up. I had an empty hard drive. I'd be spending a day reinstalling software, but I could handle that. I plugged in my backup external drive and started
copying data back into place. I breathed a sign of relief when all the family pictures were restored. I lost a weekend, but everything looked good. I went to bed Sunday night
happy and planning on finally building that backup solution. "That was almost a disaster!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-appears"&gt;The Problem Appears&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem-appears" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, I saw the family off to school and work and then settled in for my day. I went to pull up a personal project that I'd work on for an hour or so before the
work day began. Well, it turns out that one of the things I stored on that drive that hosts all my data was my personal projects. It also turns out that I never actually
backed up my personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than decade worth of personal programming projects, horrible attempts at graphic work (seriously...graphics aren't my thing), notes for games that I'd love to design if
I ever get the time were gone. I dug through my most immediate backup. I found old drives - because "you never know when you'll need it" - and dug through those. Nothing. I
have no idea how I missed this rather important directory in all my various manual and semi-automated backup routines over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd either have to suck it up and lose that history or get serious about data recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-recovery-attempt"&gt;Data Recovery Attempt&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#data-recovery-attempt" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in college, I was manager of the university's help desk. One of the tasks we performed was data recovery for students. Usually this was on flash drives that had "suddenly
deleted a paper", but occasionally we'd have to work on a hard drive too. Our recovery efforts were limited to a quick run of a handful of applications that attempted to
recovery deleted files. In the world of stressed students, this was all that was usually needed. If you could recover that term paper, thesis paper or dissertation, you were
a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what I tried. I hoped it'd work. Windows still couldn't see the back drive. A Linux LiveCD could see that a drive existed, but couldn't find any data. That was still
progress. I ran software for almost two days as it tried to find anything for me to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Nothing at all. It looked like some how erased everything from the drive. I was back to my choices - lose the history or find a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with a professional. I couldn't lose that much of my history. I still those projects for both personal and professional work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sert-data-recovery"&gt;SERT Data Recovery&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#sert-data-recovery" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with SERT Data Recovery. The technician over the phone explained their process. They asked questions that made me confident in their
ability to at least diagnose the problem, and most importantly were thousands of dollars cheaper than a competitor I spoke with. They explained their pricing structure (they
provide a quote and it won't be a giant range), and pricing for replacement parts and allowed me to either send in an empty drive or pay for one that my data would be returned
to me on. They answered my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also didn't scold me for doing the single most damaging thing to a drive. I had done it repeatedly. I had turned the bad drive back on. I had turned it on and let it spin
for days as I attempted to recover data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shipped them the drive. After the initial diagnosis came back - one of the platter heads had stopped working - I paid for the replacement part and waited. Eventually the
data was recovered with a 100% recovery rate. I was ecstatic. My data was shipped back to me and I quickly transferred my projects to the new drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint in the entire process was that the recovery process took almost seven weeks. I shipped the drive at the end of October and received the data back the week
before Christmas. However, all of my data was recovered, so it's a pretty minor complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: The link to SERT Data Recovery was removed in March of 2023 because it failed multiple link checks with multiple errors. While I am still very happy with the work they performed in 2018, as of 2023 I don't feel comfortable linking to a site that continues to fail basic SSL certificate checks and forces browsers to warn users against visiting the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a little over a month since I've transferred my data to a the new drive in my desktop. I've manually run my back up process two or three times. I'm pretty much where
I was at the beginning of October. Crossing my fingers that when I get on the computer in the morning, all my data will be there. That's not acceptable any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm finally building the backup solution. It'll be a huge (for a family) NAS. The goal is to be able to back up from Windows, Ubuntu and a couple Android phones automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next entry will cover the device itself and my choices for certain hardware. I'll follow that up with an article on the software set up to get the entire thing working.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>How I found an awesome remote only job</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-found-an-awesome-remote-only-job.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2017-11-28T09:01:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-11-28T09:01:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2017-11-28:/how-i-found-an-awesome-remote-only-job.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief walkthrough of my job hunting process&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been over three months since I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-decade-at-caterpillar.html"&gt;left my position at Caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;, but
leaving that job wasn't as simple as finding a position and changing jobs. Since
my initial post that I was changing positions, I've gotten questions from several
professional contacts that were also looking to move, but weren't entirely sure
of the process I used to find my new job. I hope to answer some of those
questions with this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-job-criteria"&gt;New Job Criteria&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#new-job-criteria" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages I had during this search was that I had a job already. This
allowed me to hunt for a job at my own pace. I didn't need a new position
immediately. The slower pace also let me set my own criteria for what I wanted
in a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="full-time-work-from-home"&gt;Full time work from home&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#full-time-work-from-home" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Caterpillar, I worked from home one to two days a week. I did this for several
years and enjoyed it. I found that I was much more productive. I was able to focus
on the work that needed to be done that day because the distractions of working
in a cube farm weren't present. I didn't hear the side conversations that I wasn't
involved in. I didn't get the "hey can you help me" questions that could be solved
with a few seconds of trying some new code. I was able to concentrate on the task
and not context switch frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the drive to and from the office was consuming almost two hours a
day. In the winter, this was brutal. I was leaving as the sun rose and getting
home well after it had set. I wasn't seeing the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most important criteria was born from these two. I wanted to be able to work
from home, full time. I was not opposed to the occasional yearly get together,
but I didn't want to go into an office on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pay-and-benefits-must-improve"&gt;Pay and benefits must improve&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pay-and-benefits-must-improve" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar had great benefits. I don't remember ever worrying about health
coverage, or prescription drug coverage. Pay was "industry average", which
always seemed a bit lower than what sites like &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com"&gt;glassdoor.com&lt;/a&gt; said I should
make. Part of this was due to the yearly bonus I was eligible for. This was
dependent on the business performance and not guaranteed. It also fluctuated a lot.
The fact that Caterpillar went through nearly five years of poor market performance
didn't help with those bonuses either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new position would need to meet or exceed the health benefits I had. The pay
would need to improve too. Working from home would have the advantage of not
paying for gas for the car as frequently. It'd also reduce the maintenance costs
of putting so many miles on the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="something-challenging"&gt;Something challenging&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#something-challenging" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new position is going to bring new challenges. It's new. You don't know the job.
But, I wanted it to be challenging after I made it over that initial period of
adjustment. I started looking for a job that would utilize my programming skills,
leadership skills from the projects I've led, and maybe some of the community
management skills I had from Team Vipers and various StackExchange communities I
participate in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-search"&gt;The search&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-search" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my initial, if broad, criteria defined. The next step was to start the hunt.
I utilized several sites to help with the initial search and to help narrow
down the list of companies I'd really like to talk with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://remoteok.io/"&gt;remote|ok&lt;/a&gt; - A job board that updates throughout the day, yet doesn't have
 thousands of postings. It is specific to the "IT-ish" world. This was helpful
 in finding companies that are open to remote jobs, because I'd see those companies
 listings repeatedly over the course of my hunt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://weworkremotely.com/"&gt;We Work Remotely&lt;/a&gt; - Another "IT-ish" job board that updates one or two
 times a day. It has multiple categories of jobs and usually is pulling in
 positions from other job boards. I preferred using this over the source sites
 because this had a much smaller set of jobs and was restricted to my area of
 interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/415299/189134"&gt;Stack Overflow Jobs&lt;/a&gt; - I have a love/hate relationship with Stack Overflow
 Jobs. On the one hand, it had &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A189134+%5Bjobs%5D"&gt;so many UI/UX issues&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand,
 it makes it really easy to find remote jobs and narrow it down to only jobs
 I'm interested in. This is where I eventually found the posting for the job I
 took.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Stack Overflow Jobs shut down in March 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm being honest, my search for a job took over eighteen months. I found
several jobs that were interesting and that I applied for, but the process was
slow. There were several false starts, several job applications were ignored,
and several interviews that didn't move forward at either my choice or the
company's choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keeping-it-all-straight"&gt;Keeping it all straight&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-it-all-straight" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put out a lot of job applications. This meant that I needed to adjust my
resume and cover letter to each company. I needed to keep track of when I applied,
who I interacted with, when interviews were scheduled, and when to give up on
a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter: &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Trello Job Search Board" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/trello-job-board.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prep: This is a reminder to update resume and cover letter for each position,
 and a list of the labels I utilize. The colored labels made it easy to identify
 the current status, and whether this was a local or remote position.
 After searching for about nine months, I started to consider office positions
 in a few specific cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interesting Positions: All new jobs I was considering would go here. It'd
 consist of a link to the job posting. This was made really easy by utilizing
 a &lt;a href="https://trello.com/add-card"&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; provided by Trello that would send any link to this list on
 this board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies to watch: As my hunt continued, I found several companies that
 seemed interesting or that had expressed interest in my skill set. I set up
 links to the job pages for each of these companies so that I could see if anything
 new and interesting was posted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitted applications: After updating my resume and cover letter, filling out
 the application forms, and pressing submit, a job posting would be moved from
 "Interesting Positions" to "Submitted Applications".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interviews: When a company liked an application and scheduled an interview, I'd
 move the card to this step. Additionally, I'd add a comment with the name of the
 people I'd be talking with - Human Resources representative, technical leads, managers -
 so that I knew who I'd be talking with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recheck opening availability: If a card sat in "Interesting Positions" for a
 period of time, I needed to check if the position  was still available before
 finally submitting an application. There were many times that I'd mark a job
 as interesting and then never apply. This list helped keep the viable list of
 positions down to what was still available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold Opportunities / Rejections: Just as I ignored positions, my applications
 were ignored many times. Other times, an interview process would just fizzle out.
 These seemed like the company didn't want to send a rejection notice and hoped
 that ignoring me would provide a hint. It was unprofessional, and I wouldn't look
 at those companies again. Other times, official rejection responses would be sent
 back. I appreciated these, even though they were rejections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="butler-for-trello"&gt;Butler for Trello&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#butler-for-trello" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last list on the board was &lt;a href="https://butlerfortrello.com/"&gt;Butler for Trello&lt;/a&gt;. This is the system that
automated a lot of the moving of jobs through the process and applying proper labels.
When a new job was added to the "Interesting Positions" list, a due date was added
for one month from now. Triggering off this due date, the butler would move cards
to "Recheck" if the due date was exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a card was moved to "Submitted Applications" the due date was changed to be
three weeks from now. The thought here was that if I haded heard from the company
in three weeks, I was probably being ignored and thus rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This automation helped keep the board clean and usable. I was always presented
with a list of openings I was interested in that were current. Moving through
the interview process, the cards would be moved if a period of time was exceeded.
I didn't need to remember to move stuff based on when I submitted an application,
or when the last interview was. It just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-the-job"&gt;Getting the job&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-the-job" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, this was a long process. That list of cold opportunities and
rejections is pretty long. I talked to a lot of different companies and went
through a lot of different interviews. Eventually, though, I found a job
advertising a Senior Integration Tester at a new start up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview process consisted of 4 interviews - one with the Senior Vice President
of Development, and three individual interviews with team leads (my peers). I also
needed to submit a project demonstrating how I'd test the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews felt like conversations. We discussed my project. I had to defend
a few decisions, but there were no wrong answers. Everyone was professional, yet
personable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, an offer was presented and after some last minute "do I really
want to make a big change in my life" doubts were squashed, I accepted. I love the
job.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jobs"/><category term="job"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's AWS Serverless APIs &amp; Apps - A Complete Introduction course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/aws-serverless-apis-apps-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2017-10-20T11:17:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-10-20T11:17:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2017-10-20:/aws-serverless-apis-apps-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the AWS Serverless APIs &amp;amp; Apps course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been involved with the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; spam hunting project for several years. In that time It's grown from
a small Python script to a large combination of Python, Ruby and user scripts. The infrastructure hasn't really changed
in that time, though, and it's starting to show. SmokeDetector, the Python script, is run by multiple users so that
random network problems that kill the instance don't take the entire system off line. Arguably, the project should
work on fixing this instability, but the alternative that we came up with works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least it did. Now this distributed way of running is starting to cause issues. Keeping each instance in sync
with one another is a very difficult problem. We've built a decent solution to this for handling spam patterns,
but we've failed to replicate this for other things like permission sets or notifications. Adding this involves
integration with GitHub and a series of new commands. It's painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the recent discussions to solve this problem was a centralized database. That brings me to this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ude.my/UC-1ESFUC2V"&gt;AWS Serverless APIs &amp;amp; Apps - A Complete Introduction&lt;/a&gt; by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller on Udemy
looked like a good overview for AWS lambda and DynamoDB, two solutions the SmokeDetector project was looking
into using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-course"&gt;Thoughts on the course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course provides a good overview of Amazon's API Gateway, AWS Lambda and several other Amazon services. There
is a little bit of coding involved - using NodeJS - but a large majority is dedicated to working in the various Amazon
consoles. Except for one optional lecture, the entire course can be completed using Amazon's free tier. This is
great for a course and one of the factors I used to determine if I really wanted to take the course. The instructor
is very clear, throughout the course, which aspects cost additional money so that no unexpected charges show up
from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course covers the API Gateway, AWS permissions, AWS Lambda, body mapping templates, DynamoDB, authentication with
Cognito and hosting a serverless SPA. At first glance this seems like a lot to cover in an 8 hour course. The instructor
has broken these into small digestible lectures that do a good job of introducing each new service, explaining the theory
behind each and then using the service to implement functionality into the course long project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A course long project is a good way to show how each of these Amazon services are useful to a larger project. Instead of
focusing on a small example project where it is difficult to expand the course work into the real world, a real world
project with various requirements is used. This project uses each of the services I mentioned above in a natural way.
Implementing new functionality doesn't feel forced, instead it is something that users would expect from a modern application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with this course. Everything was very well presented. The project was useful because I can easily understand
how each of the Amazon services function. I also have a good idea how the console works and how to troubleshoot problems
because of the work that was done in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint with regard to this course is that the video lectures are interrupted with text based lectures consisting
of more details and links to documentation. I appreciate these links and used several of them, but the interruption of the
videos to present these broke the nice flow of the lectures. Presenting these links at the end of the section, I think would be
less of an interruption. This was a minor thing, though, and doesn't take away from how much I enjoyed the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I have a decent understanding of Amazon's services at this point. I am looking forward to applying this new
knowledge and, hopefully, improving the SmokeDetector infrastructure at the same time. I highly recommend this course
if you are thinking of migrating anything to Amazon. I feel much more comfortable about moving aspects of a project
to this new solution.&lt;/p&gt;

A reflection on the Stack Overflow election.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been over two years since I first ran for moderator on Stack Overflow. &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html"&gt;I've run for moderator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html"&gt;three times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/third-times-the-charm.html"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow.
In each election I've done better, coming in fifth in the third election. Well, it's been a little over 8 months since the last one and new moderators are needed
again. I decided to run once more with the knowledge that if I lost, I probably wouldn't run again in the next election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nomination phase started off as usual, with a handful of users posting their nomination. This time there were 12 candidates, meaning there would be a primary
to narrow it down to 10 before the final election. My nomination was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;strong&gt;Andy&lt;/strong&gt;. I've answered the questions posted by the community &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/352386/2017-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire/352388#352388"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I encourage you to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-should-you-vote-for-me"&gt;Why should you vote for me?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-should-you-vote-for-me" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a moderator on &lt;a href="https://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt; for several years. I was appointed to a moderator position on &lt;a href="https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Hardware Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. I know the moderator 
tools and have worked with the current moderators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm active in the review queues (I am the top reviewer in the Low Quality Post reviewers, with over 26,500 reviews in this queue). I also enjoy the other 
moderation aspects of Stack Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that moderation can be tool assisted. I've helped to flag a sizable percentage of &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow. I've helped build the community 
&lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291301/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically"&gt;spam detection bot&lt;/a&gt;. These types of tools help eliminate the obvious bad stuff so that moderation time can be spent on the less obvious stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a history of good community moderation, am here consistently, and believe I can help the current team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2017_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nomination-reflections"&gt;Nomination Reflections&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-reflections" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An astute reader may have noticed this is pretty similar to previous nomination posts. There are a couple major differences though. The first thing is that I am the 
the number one Low Quality Posts reviewer on the site. I am pretty proud of this particular statistic. It shows just how much work I've done during my tenure at Stack 
Overflow to improve the quality of the site. The unfortunate thing is that I'd probably lose this position as a moderator because they don't sit in the review queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Low Quality Posts" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/number_1_low_quality_reviewer.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major change was that I had picked up a moderator position on Hardware Recommendations. That happened at the end of June. Hardware Recommendations is about ten 
times the size of Community Building (a site I've moderated for several years). It's also a couple orders of magnitude &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; than Stack Overflow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most exciting part of the election season is the primary phase. The community can see the scores of users over time and have built tools to watch those numbers change 
over time. It turns out that this time, my numbers were really high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Primary Results Table" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2017-07-SO-Election-Primary-Results.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of good people in the election this time. One interesting thing that I found was that a lot of candidates, like me, were supportive of automation. Several
users utilized bots that posted low quality content to various chat rooms. This is a big change from previous elections. It was a welcome change. I think that automated
quality content checking can help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election"&gt;Election&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election ended on August 1st. (&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-decade-at-caterpillar.html"&gt;A busy day for me, apparently&lt;/a&gt;). It was a close election. Most surprisingly, no one won in the first round with everyone else 
picking up carry over votes to get second. I think that speaks to the quality of the candidates. After &lt;a href="https://www.opavote.com/results/5927932925050880"&gt;8 rounds in OpaVote&lt;/a&gt;, both Cody Gray and I were elected the two newest moderators on Stack Overflow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="post-election"&gt;Post Election&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#post-election" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election ended a few weeks ago. I handled more moderator flags in my first hour as a Stack Overflow moderator than I had at both Community Building and 
Hardware Recommendations combined. What I'm saying...Stack Overflow has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of flags that need to be handled. In good news, since the election, we have gotten the
moderator queue down from about 1,100 flags to about 75 at any given time. I doubt it will stay that low, but it's still nice to see that I was immediately helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, since the election I turned off the comment flagging bot. It had been used for just over 3 years. The community is currently &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/354719/189134"&gt;debating&lt;/a&gt; whether or not it should
run under a moderator account. The thing that I am finding more interesting about this discussion is that the community seems to agree it's helpful, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/354723/189134"&gt;respects&lt;/a&gt; the 99+%
accuracy, would love for Stack Exchange themselves to run this tool, but doesn't want the bot to run with moderator privileges. There is, however, a very sizable portion of
the community that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; want this done under my account. We'll see how this plays out, but I'm hoping to be able to use the bot again soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>A reflection on my decade at Caterpillar</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-decade-at-caterpillar.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2017-07-31T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-07-31T12:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2017-07-31:/a-decade-at-caterpillar.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My career at Caterpillar has come to an end. This is a reflection on the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="right-out-of-college"&gt;Right out of college&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#right-out-of-college" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten and a half years ago, I was the manager at the university help desk and less than six months from graduation. I hadn't
heard back from the company I interned with. I was getting concerned. I went to the university's yearly career fair. I had
companies I wanted to talk with, a few that looked interesting and a handful that I knew handed out decent freebies, so I'd
stop by those too. After all, what college student is going to turn down a freebie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't remember what company I was speaking with. I remember it wasn't going well. The interviewer was making unfunny jokes about
the location of my home town and how far it was from their place of operations. I was slowly trying to extract myself from the
conversation and really wanted to take my resume back too. Finally, I was free and turned to walk away and almost knocked over
a recruiter from the next booth over. I apologized and she beamed at me. She also apologized but said it was because she'd been
listening to the conversation I'd just had. I had sounded like someone she was looking to hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped over to the booth and was introduced to the Logistics arm of Caterpillar. The interview on campus and follow up all day
interviews about two weeks later went very well. I was offered a job at a salary I was happy with. It turned out that the
company I'd had my internship with would eventually offer me a job and not even come close to the starting salary Caterpillar offered,
which made me even more satisfied. I was to start in June following graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-first-day"&gt;The first day&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-day" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My degree is not in Logistics or transportation management, yet that would be the team I was joining. I was given my boss's name. I showed up,
bright eyed and ready to begin my career at a company known the world over, and was told by the receptionist that my boss no longer worked
at this facility. She'd moved to a new area of the company less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was introduced to my new boss and the team. I was handed off to my team lead and we promptly started going over a gigantic system.
I remember being overwhelmed and confused. My college degree didn't use terms like "bill of lading" or "route optimization". I tried to keep up.
Eventually, lunch rolled around. I was handed a set of instructions on how to get myself added to the system and told to follow those after lunch.
I was young and eager. I followed the directions. In doing so, I learned how to add myself to the system. The company also learned a lesson that day:
their instructions were wrong. I followed exactly what I was given. In doing so, I locked out the system administrator account for the transportation
management system. This was a 'mistake' that is still brought up a decade later. On day one, it's a horrifying experience. A bit later, it's a harmless
first day mistake that took a few minutes for an experienced technician to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, day two went much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-revolving-door-of-bosses"&gt;A revolving door of bosses&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-revolving-door-of-bosses" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four years at Caterpillar, I met many great transportation consultants. They were very smart, had worked with many other companies and had
been all over the world. I was a bit jealous of their ability to travel. These consultants taught me about managing transportation, about setting up
a system for a new company, and helped me design and build tools to improve Caterpillar's ability to do the same. They also taught me something else
about Caterpillar: if you aren't a Caterpillar employee, your opinion matters less. They are paid a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; more than me and my more senior coworkers, but
if an idea doesn't come from an employee, it's not given fair consideration by management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this should be obvious. Those with the most experience setting up and managing systems to get parts and supplies on time to our facilities
weren't able to provide suggestions for how to improve the system even more. System growth stagnated and my first boss was replaced. The second boss came
from overseas and had experience we were trying to move to the US. Their assignment in the US lasted a year or so, and I was given a new boss again. A fourth
boss was assigned about nine months before I eventually moved to another division. Four bosses in four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, though, I built and managed some amazing applications. These included a brand new order processing system, a container management
system, and a dashboard to unify all of the different systems into one quick at a glance system. During one of the boss transitions, I was moved to sit with
my users and learn their pain points. This was one of the best decisions that came out of these first four years. By sitting with the users and talking with
them daily, I learned exactly what they had problems with. I designed simple work-arounds, automated external tools and ways to improve their pain points. My
yearly review reflected how much the customers appreciated my help and me sitting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was moved back with the rest of the IT team. At that point, I felt a bit like an outsider. I'd been sitting with my users for over a year. None of
my coworkers had been given the opportunity to do so. I was moving from the trenches back to the ivory tower. I lost the interaction with my users and I think
my team suffered because of this. We were slower to respond to issues, because now the users had to go through the official channels of calling the helpdesk
and waiting until a member of my team was assigned the problem to work with. Simple questions couldn't be answered with a two minute conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this move, a third party logistics service was brought in to 'improve' our processes. It turns out that a start up company without a large customer doesn't
know how to manage transportation for a company that spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year to move stuff around. The relationship didn't improve over time.
Instead, each side attempted blame the other for the smallest of issues. After being assigned the task of ensuring our data was transferred every day by an early time,
I started looking for another position in the company. I was tried of getting up early and missing time with the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-long-drive"&gt;The long drive&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-long-drive" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a new position fairly quickly. It was recommended to me by a friend I knew outside of work. It was a Python development position for a tool used by the entire
division. I interviewed, was offered the job, and then told by my boss I couldn't move yet. Despite asking ahead of time, the answer had changed once I was actually
offered the job. I spent months waiting to be allowed to move. Eventually, I was allowed to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one down side of this new job was its distance from my house. My first job was about 15-20 minutes away. This new one was 45 minutes away, on a good traffic day.
It was worth it though. I liked the job better. I worked much more closely with my users and over the next six years the job evolved from supporting a desktop application
to building an entire analytic environment. We built a system to track failure reasons and determine who was responsible for paying a warranty (saved millions of dollars every year since implementation), a predictive failure dashboard allowing service engineers to reach out to customers before something happened, expand from desktop to web
development and deploy a large expensive environment for hosting tons of sensor data from machines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-down-turn"&gt;The down turn&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-down-turn" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the economic situation for Caterpillar, especially after the down turn, was always "it's going to get worse before it gets better". For years, I watched
rounds of layoffs. I watched employees with decades of experience be escorted out while under-performing employees remained in place. Decades and decades of knowledge
walked out the door, never to return and were replaced, most often, with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team avoided the brunt of these layoffs, but they were never far from our doorstep. The looming threat of "maybe next time", was always there. With a large number
of layoffs, it's not surprising that someone would walk out with confidential information. It happened. IT and HR cracked down on the rest of us. First came the removal
of little things - USB access - then came the increased security on the laptops. Security software that took 4GB of memory on a fresh install. On day one of a new machine,
half of your system resources went to "security". Restarting your computer was a 15 minute process due to this software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then HR stated that you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be in the building 8 hours a day. Working from home in the evenings didn't count. This was the straw that started my job search. With a 45-60
minute drive each way, I'd come to an agreement with my boss that I'd spend a majority of the day in the office but do releases in the evenings from home. This allowed me to
be with my family at nights and finish the day after they'd gone to bed. HR's new rules eliminated this. So, I worked out the ability to work from home two days a week. This
still wasn't ideal for those three nights that I was home later, but it improved home life a bit, for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids were growing and starting to be involved in more after school activities. Activities that I had to pick and choose whether or not I could attend due to this
decree to keep my chair warm in the office. I hated missing these things. The kids hated me missing them. Then HR "reminded" us that it was still required that we are
in the office for 8 hours a day. This didn't feel like a professional work environment any more. It felt like we were being treated like little kids by HR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-new-job"&gt;The new job&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-new-job" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found a new job. My first day is, officially, tomorrow. Today is my last day at Caterpillar. It is unfortunate that I have to leave. I really enjoyed the work
and the people. My managers have worked with me (and the rest of my team) to help us be as flexible as possible. But, I can't ignore that I'm missing out on family
things more and more. Caterpillar says things like "work-life balance", but I'm not sure they actually believe that any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they do, it's not a "work life balance" for families where both parents are employed - especially if they aren't both employed at Caterpillar. A week before I found
the new job, a new flexible work schedule was announced where employees could work 80 hours over the course of 9 days instead of the usual 10, giving you every other Friday
off. At first glance, that sounds appealing. But, after minute or so of figuring of how it works there is a fatal flaw: I'd be home even later over the course of 9 days and
then be home on a Friday - when the rest of the family is at work or school. That doesn't solve anything for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new job is a full time remote position. I'll be home every day. I can step out for an hour to go to a class room party or take a morning off to go on a field trip. The flexibility I've been told about is amazing. The official vacation policy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees have the authority to use their judgment and discretion and take temporary periods of time away from work as vacation, without loss of pay, as their work permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="goodbye-yellow"&gt;Goodbye Yellow!&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#goodbye-yellow" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar has been my home for a decade. Despite my complaints about work life balance, above, I'm not leaving the company with malice or ill-intent. Caterpillar is a
large company and will continue long after I've left. The people that are there, especially my coworkers, are intelligent people who build amazing things. Unfortunately, 
in my case, Caterpillar seems to have forgotten that those intelligent people like to spend time doing things other than keeping their chairs warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for the decade of experiences, the professional relationships, and chances to work on interesting projects. Caterpillar, I wish you well in the future. If you
are going to listen to one piece of advice from a former employee, I recommend you take a look at those employees in your work force where the household is a dual career house.
Your work life balance initiatives do not appear to account for those employees and it is for that reason that you lost me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye Yellow. I'll always remember my time with you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jobs"/><category term="job"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/django-fullstack-bootcamp-course-review.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2017-06-28T06:16:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-06-28T06:16:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2017-06-28:/django-fullstack-bootcamp-course-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ploughing through &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html"&gt;two machine learning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-linear-logistic-regression.html"&gt;prerequisite courses&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to have a change in content for the next
course I took. I've used Django in the past to build &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/IRVING"&gt;IRVING&lt;/a&gt; - a dashboard that allows users to run queries against many
database types and display the results in one location. The majority of this was done almost 6 years ago though. It was built
to assist in a job I no longer hold. Since then, I've ignored it and haven't used Django for a major project. I have used it to
test a small snippet of code here or there, but never a complete application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember liking Django. To that end, I decided to take Jose Portilla's &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;
course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-course"&gt;Thoughts on the course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am conflicted on how to rate this course. On the one hand, it covers a lot in the 30ish hours that the lectures take. Starting at
the very basics and moving through more advanced Django topics, it covers HTML and CSS then moves to Bootstrap, Javascript, the DOM,
jQuery, and Python before finally getting to Django. On the other hand, it moves through those basic lectures very slowly. Django isn't
even reached until two thirds of the way through the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lectures were a combination of hands on coding and an explanation of what the code is doing. The instructor types slightly
faster than me. This was a problem only at transitions between files, for example moving between an HTML file and a CSS file. I found myself
rewinding the video lectures many times around these transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I liked very early on in the lecture was the introduction of GitHub's &lt;a href="https://atom.io/"&gt;ATOM text editor&lt;/a&gt;. I've used this once before, for a job
interview that went very poorly (another story, for another time). I'd heard good things about it though. I used it throughout the course as a way to
force myself to use something other than PyCharm. Now that the course is complete, I have decided that I like ATOM, but not enough to switch from
PyCharm. It does have some nice features, especially with plugins, that I may utilize when building boiler plate code and templates though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="foundation-vs-django-content"&gt;Foundation vs Django content&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#foundation-vs-django-content" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundational material - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery and even the Python - dragged on a little long for my taste. As I
mentioned above, this foundation took up the first two thirds of the course. I'd have preferred it if more time could be spent covering
other aspects of Django, especially some of the concepts that are thrown at the student in the last clone project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Django content, itself, was great. It started at basics like setting up a project and single application within the project and
moved through URL routing, templates, views and briefly touched on the admin side. There were advanced topics on class based views and
the debug toolbar, both of which are important when developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help feeling that important things were missed though. For example, the admin side is barely touched. It is incredibly capable, yet the
most that is done in this course with the admin backend is registering a model to appear. Groups and permissions aren't touched at all. Customizing
views in the backend aren't mentioned, either. Another thing that I was hoping would be covered as part of the "and much,much more!" bullet in the
course description was both &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/signals/"&gt;signals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/sep/09/channels-adopted-official-django-project/"&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;, but they are not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone projects are useful in giving students a "real world" example that they are familiar with to bring everything they've learned together. There
are two such projects in this course, a blog and a message board/social media site. The blog one was a logical extension of the 5 parts that were
covered by Django. The message board, however, wasn't as useful. In an effort to be more "real world", the instructor missed a lot of steps in the
preceding foundational lectures. This project introduces multiple applications in the same project, but never introduced that concept previously
and doesn't expand on it much here. Instead, the project becomes a combination of speed coding to keep up with what's happening in the lecture and
copy and pasting code from the notes when the instructor does the same thing. I appreciate the more realistic project, but for all the time that was
spent building the foundation of Django knowledge, there is a big gap between the last lecture and this clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was worthwhile, once I made it through the foundational courses. It was a great refresher for what I'd done 6 years ago. Either I did
things very inefficiently then, or Django has had a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of improvements (or both), but looking back at IRVING, I see many things that could be
improved. I'm not sure if I actually will though, just due to not using the application any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long foundational courses either should have been condensed. I would have rather had more focus on Django and covered more topics there. This
is especially true after completing the second clone project. New concepts were used in this project, but glossed over as "there is excellent
documentation on this", instead of the in depth explanations that were provided earlier in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend this course for the Django topics. However, if you are coming into the course with any type of web development background (even the
relatively basic one I have), be prepared to be bored during the first half of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

I have feedback as an experienced community member on how those decisions are perceived&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow launched in 2008. As it nears it's 9th year of operation, I am afraid the resource that I depend on is losing it's way. Stack Overflow launched after I graduated college. I can't imagine how helpful it would have been during that time period, but it's been invaluable in my professional career. I &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; the site about a year after it's public launch, in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that time, I've gone from lurker to participant to moderator candidate (several times). I know Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Overflow. I am a moderator on another Stack Exchange site and have a good understanding of how the network operates. I also am one of the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/top_lqp_queue.png"&gt;most prolific reviewers&lt;/a&gt; in the Stack Overflow &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/stats"&gt;Low Quality Posts review queue&lt;/a&gt; and have built several applications that work with the Stack Exchange API. I am a power user and know the network and the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those credentials out of the way, I want you to understand that I am active on the network. I am in good standing on Stack Overflow and am not a disgruntled user. I am a concerned user. I am getting more and more concerned that Stack Overflow - the company - is losing it's way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn't another "Stack Overflow sucks" post (Google if you're curious). I'm going to present a few areas that I'm concerned about and hopefully provide either my suggestions for improvement or acknowledge that I don't know the solution but want the team to be aware of in the future. I still believe Stack Overflow is an incredible resource. I'd just like it to fix some of the perceived missteps that have occurred over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-going-wrong"&gt;What's going wrong?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-going-wrong" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, Stack Overflow has made several changes that the established community hasn't liked. Some of these changes still are not liked. These changes include the Teams feature, the new top bar, the Stack Overflow (versus existing Stack Exchange) mobile app, and Documentation. There have also been minor missteps that have caused a rift between portions of the community and the company. These areas include multiple political stances, and a number of post quality improvements that haven't been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these, separately, is a minor problem that could be worked through and moved on from. The problem I'm seeing is that taken together, all of these are causing a rift between users, power users and the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's work through each of these items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="teams"&gt;Teams&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#teams" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams was &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/307513/189134"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in October 2015 and &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/308601/189134"&gt;clarified&lt;/a&gt; a week later. It was then &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/330427/189134"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; after nine months. The &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams/"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; it used to go to now has the following blurb (emphasis is mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams was in private beta for almost a year with 295 teams created and while we believe in its potential value, after a lot of consideration weâve decided to un-ship the idea for the time being. Weâve realized that making a successful version of the Team page, as we originally proposed would ultimately take more time and resources than we want to devote to it. &lt;strong&gt;Our resources are currently allocated on projects to enhance and improve quality on Q&amp;amp;A, Documentation, and Jobs on Stack Overflow, as a result we donât have the dedicated developers to get Teams to its fullest potential.&lt;/strong&gt; The intention was to add more features to Teams, but we never expanded it to anything beyond a team description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasized section sounds good, except that the one section that is taking up a majority of time (Documentation) has it's own major issues. The area that many power users want developers to focus on is Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Teams, and many of the projects mentioned in this post, is that this was a feature that removed focus on areas the community wanted improved. Meta Stack Overflow has been asking for improvements to reduce the number of low quality posts for years. Moderators have been asking for better tooling. The review queues are overflowing with tasks and the number of users performing reviews isn't high enough to keep up. Teams was built without a true end goal and users weren't entirely sure what to do with it. This was the first in a series of mis-steps that continue to plague community interactions when new features are announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="top-bar"&gt;Top Bar&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#top-bar" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new top bar was &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/337745/189134"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in November 2016. It went through a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/341806/189134"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/343103/189134"&gt;iterations&lt;/a&gt; before being &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/343653/189134"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in mid-February 2017. During the iterations users provided feedback. When initially released, though, much of this feedback felt ignored. Things like &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/343216/189134"&gt;notification overload&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/343483/189134"&gt;stickiness of the top bar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/346653/189134"&gt;hidden review counts&lt;/a&gt; were all mentioned during the three months of testing but not implemented until the change was live to millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three months of usage, a larger problem was noticed. One of the review queues was &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/349118/189134"&gt;constantly full&lt;/a&gt;. One of the changes that was made with this top bar was that the "Review" button no longer linked directly to the "Suggested Edits" review queue. Now it went to the page showing all review queues. Users that used to click once to get to a review queue were now presented with a list of queues to work in. Some of these queues are much more time consuming that others. It turns out the number of &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/349125/189134"&gt;reviews being done has decreased significantly&lt;/a&gt; since the top bar was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/stackoverflow_active_reviewers_per_week.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Active Reviewer per week" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/stackoverflow_active_reviewers_per_week.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in reviews in February 2017 is when the new top by was released. Since that release, the number of reviewers has plummeted. This has been attributed to notification fatigue and not linking users directly to the Suggested Edits queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months after implementation, it took the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/349204/189134"&gt;community asking for results&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;disclaimer: I asked the question&lt;/em&gt;), to find out how the top bar has been performing. It turns out that the top bar is &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/349386/189134"&gt;performing decently well&lt;/a&gt; compared to what the developers were expecting, with the exception of fewer review tasks being performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this project, is that it's felt unneeded and has materially impacted one of the quality control features of the site. There is still a vocal group of users that don't like it because it doesn't match the rest of the network. Several are concerned about the review queue problem. Experienced users felt that they were ignored during the beta tests. Users provided feedback and examples of problems and it was only after implementation when millions of other users experienced the same thing that these changes were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mobile-app"&gt;Mobile App&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mobile-app" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent announcement (as in last week, at the time of this post) announced a new &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/349255/189134"&gt;Stack Overflow mobile application&lt;/a&gt;. The community response was not positive. Users asked why a new application was being built when one already existed (the response was "branding"). Users asked why the new app was less functional than the existing one (it's limited to Stack Overflow versus the entire Stack Exchange network). Users asked why it took a year to develop and why the existing application hasn't received bug fixes in that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most disappointing things about this is a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349255/stack-overflow-now-has-its-own-app-on-ios-and-android#comment474055_349271"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; I received in the comments from the VP of Engineering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@Andy You're right, it wasn't worth a year. There's a long, sad story here, but it was originally expected to only take a few months and... well, here we are a year later. We decided to go ahead and launch and see what we can learn, and we'll reassess from here. â David Fullerton? May 17 at 16:26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another user expressed the dissatisfaction in a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/349335/189134"&gt;very pointed way&lt;/a&gt;. They provided a list of features that the community has asked for over the years that many feel have been ignored. The VP's &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349255/stack-overflow-now-has-its-own-app-on-ios-and-android#comment474166_349335"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to this wasn't encouraging either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that there are a lot of issues on Stack Overflow that need to be addressed, and maybe we haven't been responding to them as quickly as we should. But Stack Overflow Q&amp;amp;A is a big, established product, most of the problems left are hard, and we can't let maintenance become the only thing we work on or we'll just slowly run out of money and go out of business. We are trying to both maintain Q&amp;amp;A and solve new problems for developers and reach new audiences. The latter is hard, and maybe we'll fail on a lot of our ideas, but we're not going to stop trying. â David Fullerton? May 17 at 21:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like work on the Q&amp;amp;A side is feature frozen at this point. They are done innovating in this area and instead are focused on drawing in users via other features - like Jobs or Documentation. Multiple times in the comments the new app was promoted as being able to use the Dev Story or Jobs features in the future. Perhaps it's just me, but I don't apply for jobs via my phone. That doesn't seem like a good way to really put the effort needed into a cover letter or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we've reached Documentation. This is the project that's sucked up development time over the past two years. This is the project that Stack Overflow developers are defending tooth and nail and the community has all but given up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation was &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303865/189134"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; back in August 2015. It's had a ton of &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/340826/189134"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; since then. It was met with initial enthusiasm but that quickly turned around. When the system launched for all users, one of the first complaints was that the reputation generated via documentation was doing back things to the main Q&amp;amp;A site. This resulted in a &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/328703/189134"&gt;massive recalculation of reputation&lt;/a&gt; and resulted in many users losing &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of their internet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change that was announced with the introduction of a new &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/331663/189134"&gt;review queue for documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, developers didn't expect the low quality to begin immediately, it seems. Long time users weren't surprised. Now we've reached the point where the company is realizing that the users knew what they were talking about. &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/349410/189134"&gt;Documentation is undergoing a massive change&lt;/a&gt;, to the point that much of it is being completely redone - not fixed - scraped and redone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has years worth of feedback from the community that has been ignored. It is the black sheep of Stack Overflow and many community users feel that quality of the content is lacking so badly that they don't participate any longer. This feeling isn't helped that many users have been explaining &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things aren't working for a while and it's only after two years the developers are starting to realize the private beta testers, public beta testers and experienced community users mentioned many of these problems. In this particular instance, the company took &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/listen-to-your-community-but-dont-let-them-tell-you-what-to-do/"&gt;Jeff Atwood's advice&lt;/a&gt; (co-founder or Stack Overflow) to not let the community tell you what to do to heart. To the company's surprise, a community of developers that live in programming documentation had decent thoughts on what does and does not work in programming documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="politics"&gt;Politics&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#politics" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many users, the lack of true social features on Stack Overflow and across the Stack Exchange network has been a good thing. You can't easily follow a single user, you can't send private messages to a user, and you can't really do anything on the site that isn't public to everyone. The focus is on content, not opinions or social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This breaks down once and a while though when a big political thing occurs. The two most frequently mentioned instances are the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/297871/189134"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2111821/obergefell-v-hodges.pdf"&gt;Obergefell v. Hodges&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court decision and the response to President Trump's &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/342440/189134"&gt;initial immigration executive order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these caused huge uproars within the community when the company took a stand. These stands caused problems due to users holding opposite political views, users not wanting politics on their programming site, users not wanting to deal with the drama caused by the vocal members of the other groups. This led to an &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/342903/189134"&gt;apology&lt;/a&gt;. The community wasn't pleased with this apology. Users mentioned in multiple answers to this apology that they don't want the company to post such political agendas on the site. It's out of place for a programmer community. Both of these instances are still brought up on Meta when the community feels that the company is imposing on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really have advice or suggestions on this problem other than "I don't want to see this on Stack Overflow, because these hot button issues cause so much drama that nothing gets accomplished". These posts grind Meta and chatrooms to a halt while everyone expresses their opinion on the post, on the post's existance, on one another and on related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="quality-improvements"&gt;Quality Improvements&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#quality-improvements" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the community has been asking for years about ways to improve the quality of posts on the site. Stack Exchange &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/285889/186281"&gt;started a project to improve the quality&lt;/a&gt; back in October 2016. This generated 80 different suggestions on how the community sees "quality improvement" taking place. Since then there haven't been any updates on the status of this project or even subprojects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was brought up during all of the projects listed above by long time users. The hope was that this quality project would help. Being ignored hasn't brought any good feelings. The lower quality has been measurable and seen less participation from experienced users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-fix"&gt;The Fix&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-fix" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above I've pointed out several issues that I've seen over the past two years. These issues are part of a bigger problem though. It seems that Stack Overflow doesn't know to how handle it's community size any longer. It's in the top 300 sites visited in the US and receives &lt;a href="https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com#trafficCard"&gt;half a billion views globally per month&lt;/a&gt;. Couple this with the fact that they &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349255/stack-overflow-now-has-its-own-app-on-ios-and-android#comment474175_349335"&gt;don't have a sustainable business model yet&lt;/a&gt; and have a sizable team with good benefits and they are getting concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A is what built Stack Overflow, but it isn't enough to sustain them. Thus, the other projects are being created. Unfortunately, in this process, it seems the company is forgetting it's existing user base at the expense of expanding to new users. Existing users are getting frustrated with the lack of quality improvements, being ignored and not having changes that benefit their use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation has taken up a giant chunk of time and developer effort and it's all been wasted. The &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/349410/189134"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it is being redone has been met with "thanks" from the community, along with warnings to consider that "quality" problem. We'll see how it plays out, or if that quality issue is ignored like their own Quality Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the final point I want to make. I think the feeling of Q&amp;amp;A being "done" is the biggest problem I've had with Stack Overflow over the last year. New features aren't being built in that space. Instead of focusing on some of the "hard" problems, the company is throwing stuff at the wall and hoping something will stick. Unfortunately, the four biggest projects in the last year have either failed completely (Teams, Documentation, Mobile App...perhaps) or have significant unintended consequences that isn't helping the quality issue users have been reporting for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power users, the underlying community that has put time and effort into growing Stack Overflow to that it is today, is feeling ignored. It is only after months or years long experiments fail that community opinions are finally validated or considered. Users have expressed concerns in each of the above projects repeatedly. Yet, those opinions were not addressed. The silos that the developers have built around themselves are causing the company to lose touch with it's community. This is being done at the expense of alienating the users that care and the cost of developer time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users want a high quality site with answers to their questions. Even new or potentially new users want this. Stack Overflow continues to avoid dealing with that problem because "it's hard". The unfortunate thing is, this is costing the site &lt;a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/674690#graph"&gt;users that return to provide more than one answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/stackoverflow_return_users.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stack Overflow Return Answerers" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/stackoverflow_return_users.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart is showing the number of answers provided per month by different types of users. Users that have provided more than 100 answers, between 11 and 100 answers, between 2 and 10 answers and only a single answer. The furthest data point on the right is an artifact of being an incomplete month. From this chart, we can see that the only group that has continued to rise are users that provide a single answer over time. The other groups took a steep drop in April 2014 and haven't recovered since then. The number of experienced users that are participating has dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened in April 2014? That's been &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/320234/189134"&gt;answered&lt;/a&gt; by a Stack Overflow community manager. The theory is that users aren't getting answers to their questions and due to being ignored they never return to participate further in the site. Another community manager also provided an &lt;a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/320440/189134"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting around 2013 and peaking around March, 2014, people began asking fewer interesting questions. That lead to a decrease in voting on questions and fewer answers being given. Since the feedback on these uninteresting questions was discouraging, people began asking fewer questions on the whole. Meanwhile, truly poor questions continued being asked with little regard to negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow users began noticing increasing numbers of truly awful questions and decided, rightly, that downvoting and refusing to answer them is the best remedy. These questions fit broad categories of awful and users began withholding votes from questions that were not themselves awful, but bore some of the markers of awful. Fewer of these questions got answered and askers of mediocre questions did not see any point in trying to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began a slow spiral downward. Not all is lost though, because there are the upticks. I hope it's enough to break the cycle, but I really fear that something needs to be done about this quality issue. This is the issue that is brought up by the experienced community.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-to-from-here"&gt;Where to from here?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#where-to-from-here" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to invest my time and effort into the community, but even as an active user who really wants the company and community to succeed, it's getting harder and harder to ignore that those of us that have been around for years are not being listened to any more. We're being treated as the grumpy old person that grumbles about the way things used to be. Our experiences on the site are brushed aside as being unhelpful to new users. That completely ignores that fact that we are still trying to reach the goal on which Stack Overflow was created: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour"&gt;"With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed answers to every question about programming."&lt;/a&gt; To do this, we need high quality questions and answers so that we can actually provide help to all users. I think &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the biggest challenge that Stack Overflow is going to face in the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want Stack Overflow to continue to grow. I also want Stack Overflow to have high quality content. I think my experience and the experience of others can help build the features to accomplish this. We just need Stack Overflow to refocus on the Q&amp;amp;A portion of their network again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's Deep Learning Prerequisites - Linear and Logistic Regression courses</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-linear-logistic-regression.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2017-05-03T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-05-03T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2017-05-03:/deep-learning-prereq-linear-logistic-regression.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of the Deep Learning Prerequisites - Linear and Logistic Regression courses on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html"&gt;last review&lt;/a&gt; covered &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/"&gt;Lazy Programmer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Numpy prerequisites course&lt;/a&gt; on Udemy. In my goal to learn more about NLP,
I'm continuing through the courses this instructor has designed. To this end, that requires two additional prerequisites: 
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-science-linear-regression-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-science-logistic-regression-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/a&gt;. This review covers those two separate courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two courses are each short three hour courses giving a crash course in how to perform linear regression analysis and logistic
regression analysis. The courses cover both the theoretical math needed and the more practical Python code needed. The instructor
states, several times, that simply copying the code isn't good enough in the later courses. The mathematical background is needed to
succeed later. With that in mind, I spent most of these lectures relearning much of the math. The instructor provides several detailed
"Theory" lectures and I found those helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the theory is introduced, the next step is applying this in code. The instructor's code is short and to the point. It shows the
what was just taught and provides efficient &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; code to convert the theory into something workable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I'm happy with the instructor and their teaching style. I think this will go well with the future courses I'm planning on taking
that are by the same person. I'm continuing to brush up on those math skills that haven't been used in a while, but at this point, I am happy
with how everything is heading for this series of courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've posted my &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Deep-Learning-Prerequisites"&gt;IPython Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub for all three of the courses related to the prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still looking forward to taking the &lt;a href="https://lazyprogrammer.me/deep-learning-courses/"&gt;courses designed by the Lazy Programmer&lt;/a&gt;. The series of prerequisites were very helpful in helping
me to catch up on the skills I'll need, but didn't know (or remember much of) ahead of time. With the actual content coming up, I am hoping
the lecture style and hands on coding sections continue be the same quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linear and Logistic Regression courses didn't require much in terms of software - Python, numpy, pandas and matplotlib - but I still need to
decide how I'm going to proceed with the courses. I'm not sure whether or not I want to set up a Linux machine or a virtual machine. Windows doesn't
seem to play well with all the libraries I'll be needing. It may make my life easier too. So far, everyone seems to be using a Mac or Linux machine to
teach these courses and offer only basic "It may work on Windows" advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; project is over three years old at this point. It's grown from a small python script to a
decently sized application that integrates with another project. In that time, it's expanded what types of spam and
patterns it looks for, what chat rooms it posts to, what external services it integrates with and how permissions to
use the system are determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed under the hood. I was hoping to put a cool chart here showing code change over time, but some early
decisions with the project really throw off the chart. Using a &lt;a href="https://erikbern.com/2016/12/05/the-half-life-of-code.html"&gt;Ship of Theseus&lt;/a&gt; analogy for code, you can see how
much has changed. The basic idea is, if a ship leaves port and replaces every plank along it's journey, is it still the
same ship when it returns? With code, the idea is to apply this to lines of code in an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/smokey-git-theseus-all.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="SmokeDetector - Git of Theseus" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/smokey-git-theseus-all.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-happened-in-2014"&gt;What happened in 2014?!&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-happened-in-2014" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2014, the project attempted their first machine learning method of detecting spam. In this time period, a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/commit/102aa9c64edafb7f5fef5ba16414f4cefad03d64"&gt;commit&lt;/a&gt; was added that added about 200,000 lines of code to the project. This was almost all training data for a
Bayesian algorithm. It wasn't needed and probably shouldn't have been added to the main repository. Unfortunately, it
stayed in the repository for over a year and was finally &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/commit/68d49ccc0b4981a4ebe91d993f42643542e44d80"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; in late 2015. This is the cause of the weird graph
above, and why almost everything added in 2014 looks like it's missing in later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-has-really-changed"&gt;What has really changed?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-has-really-changed" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eliminating that Bayesian directory from git history, you can get a much better idea of how much has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/smokey-git-theseus-filtered.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="SmokeDetector - Git of Theseus - Filtered" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/smokey-git-theseus-filtered.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very little of the original code, written in 2014, remains untouched. The explosion in code after that is due to
new detection patterns, chat commands (and a rewrite), integration with MetaSmoke and the introduction of blacklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more dramatically, you can see how long a line of code is expected to survive in the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/smokey-git-theseus-survival.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="SmokeDetector - Line Survival Rate" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/smokey-git-theseus-survival.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within one year, the team is removing over 40% what's been committed to the repository. Looking at these commits,
it was determined that a vast majority aren't even &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;. They are new items to blacklist or new patterns to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="enter-the-database"&gt;Enter the database&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#enter-the-database" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this type of data can be stored in a database and managed outside of code. In early 2017, those discussions
started taking place. Several team members come from a Ruby background and were familiar with it's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt; method of
accessing databases. They wanted something similar when a database was brought into SmokeDetector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of research was done and it was narrowed down to &lt;a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/"&gt;peewee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-choose" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the SmokeDetector team, there weren't any strong opinions either way. The biggest reason for choosing
one over the other came down to a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4tnqai/choosing_a_python_ormpeewee_vs_sqlalchemy/d5jyuug/"&gt;comment made by the peewee author&lt;/a&gt; on reddit. They state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] SQLAlchemy is the gold standard for ORM in the Python world. It has a very active community and a maintainer
who is committed to excellence. If you're a glass-half-empty guy, to put it another way, you can't go wrong if you
choose SQLAlchemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weaknesses they list for using their own package is the smaller ecosystem, support and number of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="technical-differences"&gt;Technical differences&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#technical-differences" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a boring story though. Not to be deterred from such a glowing review from a competitor, I wanted to see what the
technical differences were between the two solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I put together a small Python notebook showing the &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/AWegnerGitHub/201dbaf09740f9ecd797c32ebfc15872"&gt;differences between peewee and SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt; in a
handful of tests. These tests included inserting two settings in an SQLite database, retrieving one, inserting a large
list of users and then retrieving a subset of those users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were...unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/peewee-vs-sqlalcheme-results.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="peewee vs SQLAlchemy results" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/peewee-vs-sqlalcheme-results.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two libraries each took two tests (out of four) for being faster than the other. In both cases where SQLAlchemy was
faster, it was between two and six times faster. Where peewee was faster it was between a fraction faster and twice as
fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time scales are so small though, and SmokeDetector doesn't need to have thousands, hundreds or even tens of hits to
the database a second. A hundred extra milliseconds isn't going to cripple anything it handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the choice was made based on the recommendation of the author of the peewee library. SQLAlchemy has a larger
community and better support.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>Review of Udemy's 'Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python' course</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2017-04-20T22:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-04-20T22:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2017-04-20:/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My review of "Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python" on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/"&gt;Lazy Programmer's&lt;/a&gt; Deep Learning courses on Udemy. A couple of those seem very interesting, specifically the ones
about Natural Language Processing. I'd love to be able to enhance either my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;comment flagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically.html"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt;
with language processing capabilities. I also have tried, multiple times, to come up with a way to detect duplicate questions on
Stack Overflow, but my limited knowledge of true NLP concepts has proved to be unhelpful in that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the goal of getting to the NLP courses and completing a few other data science and machine learning courses this year. I've
picked out a few that look interesting and useful in either personal or professional projects. That will be my main focus in the next
several months. When I need a break from these topics, I may find another soft skills course to look at. Or, I have a play through of
Witcher 3 waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start this journey, I need to cover some prerequisites. Data Science and Machine learning utilize several important libraries and
I need to know them or brush up my skills when using them. I took the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/data-analysis-with-pandas-review.html"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;/a&gt; last winter and found that helpful.
Lazy Programmer offers one covering the numpy stack. That's what I just finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python&lt;/a&gt; is a brief two hour course that gives a crash course in how to use numpy, pandas,
matplotlib and scipy. It touches each of these &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; briefly. The goal of the course isn't to get you intimately familiar with the libraries.
The goal is to get you to know the libraries exist and a few of their most common tasks. In this regard, it was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course also served as a nice introduction to the instructor and their teaching style. It is all hands on though, which I like. I prefer
to do the coding (and add my own comments along the way) to watching someone present a huge chunk of code and walk through that line by
line. I've posted my &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Deep-Learning-Prerequisites"&gt;IPython Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing this course does is introduce users to the assumptions the instructor makes about the students. Machine learning and data science,
in general, have a lot of math behind them. The instructor assumes that students have the theoretical background for this and teaches how to
implement this math in Numpy. Note to self: Brush up on those math skills. I haven't used some of this in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction course to the bigger &lt;a href="https://lazyprogrammer.me/deep-learning-courses/"&gt;"Deep Learning" courses&lt;/a&gt; that Lazy Programmer offers. It does it's job well and has increased my
confidence in the instructor. My last couple courses haven't been great and I'm happy that this quick two hour course was available. I'm looking
forward to taking some more of these courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will need to consider as I go through this course: whether or not to either set up a Linux machine or a virtual machine. Windows doesn't
seem to play well with all the libraries I'll be needing. It may make my life easier too. So far, everyone seems to be using a Mac or Linux machine to
teach these courses and offer only basic "It may work on Windows" advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished the &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job/learn/v4/overview"&gt;"Become a Product Manager  | Learn the Skills &amp;amp; Get the job"&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy. I had picked
this up in December during one of Udemy's frequent $15 dollars. I was looking to take something non-technical that covers
more of the "soft skills" I utilize in my job. I do a lot of software "product manager" work, without the title, at my job
and was hoping to brush up on those skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is billed as a 13 hour course, with activities and interviews with product managers. The course is taught by
Cole Mercer (a Senior product manager at &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;) and Evan Kimbrell (founder of &lt;a href="http://www.sprintkick.com/"&gt;Sprintkick&lt;/a&gt;). The course is
packed with useful content, resources and interviews. I learned a lot and reinforced a lot of what I already knew. That
information will be incredibly useful at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That glowing review said, I had a hard time getting through the lessons. Despite the amount of useful information, I found
the lessons to be...boring, at best. At worst, the instructors attempted to throw jokes in that just didn't work for this format.
That type of distraction made it hard to stick with the lessons. Additionally, the quizzes that cropped up occasionally, were
treated as a joke by the course creators. There were joke answers, there were joke explanations for answers and their were
questions unrelated to the content but instead about the instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are several points in the lessons that ask students to go the message board and provide feedback, do a quick activity,
and interact with one another. I did a couple of these. I stopped doing them when I didn't receive any responses from either other
students or the instructors. A closer look at the message board shows this is very common. I have to scroll back through a couple
"load more" clicks on the message board to find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; posts that even have a response. The interaction I was hoping for from the
instructors just doesn't exist with this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content in this course is amazingly helpful. There are links to articles that I'll be able to use for years. The information
in the lectures is also helpful, if you can get through the bland presentation of the material. The frequent, distracting, jokes and
lack of interaction makes this course less stellar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'd consider this a middle of the road course. The presentation is what drags down this information packed course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was originally &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291301/186281"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Exchange on February 20, 2017. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291301/186281"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Exchange and post there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post was featured across the entire Stack Exchange network for a week, too. This drove a huge amount of traffic
to the question and resulted in some valuable feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-featured-announcement.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Featured Announcement" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-featured-announcement.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;a href="http://charcoal-se.org/people.html"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; did it, so... yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-this"&gt;What is this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcoal is the &lt;a href="http://charcoal-se.org/people.html"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; bot and other &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE"&gt;nice things&lt;/a&gt;. This bot scans new 
posts across the entire network for spam posts and reports them to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Chat-Rooms"&gt;various chatrooms&lt;/a&gt; where people can act on them. 
If a post has been created or edited, anywhere on the network, we've probably seen it. The bot utilizes our knowledge 
of how spammers work and what they have previously posted to come up with common patterns and rules to detect spam in
the new and updated posts. You've likely seen the SmokeDetector bot if you visit chatrooms such as
&lt;a href="http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/89/tavern-on-the-meta"&gt;Tavern on the Meta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq"&gt;Charcoal HQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers"&gt;SO Close Vote Reviewers&lt;/a&gt; and others across the network. Over time, the 
bot has become very accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are leveraging the years of data and accuracy to automatically cast spam flags. With approximately 58,000 posts 
to draw from and over 46,000 true positives, we have a vast trove of data to utilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-problem-does-this-address"&gt;What problem does this address?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-problem-does-this-address" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, &lt;strong&gt;spam&lt;/strong&gt;. Stack Exchange is one of the most popular networks of websites on the Internet, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; 
of it gets spammed at some point. Our statistics show that we see about 100 spam posts per day, on average over the 
last three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent chunk of this isn't the type you'd want to see at work (or at all). The faster we can get this off the home 
page, the better for all involved. Unfortunately, it's not unheard of for spam to last several hours, even on the 
larger sites such as Graphic Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, efforts with Smokey have significantly cut the time it takes for spam to be deleted. This 
project is an extension of that, and it's now well within reach to delete spam within seconds of it being posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-doing"&gt;What are we doing?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-we-doing" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 3 years, SmokeDetector has reported potential spam across the Stack Exchange network so that users can flag 
the posts as appropriate. Users have provided feedback to inform the bot on whether the detection was correct or not 
(referred to as "feedback"). This feedback is stored in our web dashboard, &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/"&gt;metasmoke&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;). Over time, we've 
used this feedback to evaluate our patterns ("reasons") and improve our accuracy. &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/reason/106"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/reason/21"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt; 
are over 99.9% &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/reason/61"&gt;accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early last year, and after getting a baseline accuracy from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1933347/jmac"&gt;jmac&lt;/a&gt; (thank you!), we realized we could use the 
system to automatically cast spam flags. On Stack Overflow the current accuracy of users flagging spam posts is 85.7%. 
Across the rest of the network users are 95.4% accurate. We determined we can beat those numbers and eliminate spam 
from Stack Overflow and the rest of the network even faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail (if you really want it, it's available on our &lt;a href="https://charcoal-se.org/flagging"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;), we leverage the 
accuracy of each existing reason to come up with a weight indicating how certain the system is that a post is spam. If 
this value exceeds a specific threshold, the system will cast up to three spam flags on the post. We cast multiple 
flags utilizing a number of different users' accounts and the Stack Exchange API. Via metasmoke, users are given the 
opportunity to &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/ocs"&gt;enable their accounts to be used to flag spam&lt;/a&gt; (You can too, if you've made it this far). When a 
post is eligible for flagging because it exceeded the threshold set by each individual user, accounts are randomly 
selected from the pool of enabled users to cast a single flag each, up to a maximum of three per post so that we never 
unilaterally nuke something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-our-safety-checks"&gt;What are our safety checks?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-our-safety-checks" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed the entire system with accuracy and sanity checks in mind. Our design collaborations are available for 
your browsing pleasure (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bg0u4oY9W_skp79wSnyQWttUIBH8WV46JELDGJ7Bixo/edit"&gt;RFC 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1voGyl3BUA1JHJ0pR2Mf9E5-wmIDUFC1G8HcThiS7B1k/edit"&gt;RFC 2&lt;/a&gt;, RFC 3 (no longer available)). The major things that make this system safe and sane 
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We give users a choice as to how accurate they want to be with their automatic flags. Before casting any flags, we 
 check that the preferences the user has set result in a spam detection accuracy of over 99.5% over a sample of at 
 least 1000 posts. Remember, the current accuracy of humans is 85.7% on SO and network wide it is 95.4%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not unilaterally spam nuke a post, regardless of how sure we are it is spam. This means that a human &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; 
 be involved to finish off a post, even on the few sites with lower spam thresholds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weâve designed the system to be tolerant of faults - if thereâs a malfunction anywhere in the system, any user with 
 access to SmokeDetector can immediately halt all automatic flagging - this includes all network moderators. If this 
 happens, it needs a system administrator to step in to re-enable flags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've discussed this with a community manager and have their &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/35437121#35437121"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; on the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been casting an average of 60-70 automatic flags per day for over two months, for a total of just over 4000 
flags network wide. These flags were cast by 22 different users. In that time, we've had &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/logs?filter=fps"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; false positives. 
We would like to be able to automatically cancel these particular cases. This isn't possible though, so we've created 
a feature request to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/288120/allow-retracting-flags-from-the-api"&gt;retract flags via the API&lt;/a&gt;. In the mean time, the flags are either manually retracted by the 
user or declined by a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above graph plots the weight of the reasons against its overall volume of reports and accuracy. As minimum weight 
increases, accuracy (yellow line and rightmost Y-axis) and total reports (blue line) on the left-hand scale increase. 
The green line represents the number of true positives, which are verified by SmokeDetector user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows the number of posts we've automatically flagged per day over the last month. The jump on February 15th, is 
due to increasing the number of automatic flags from 1 per post to 3 per post. You can see a live version of this graph 
on &lt;a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging"&gt;metasmoke's autoflagging page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-spam-hours.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spam Hours" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-spam-hours.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spam arrives on Stack Exchange in waves. It is easy to see the time of day that many spam reports come in. The hours, 
above, are UTC time. The busiest spam times of day are the 8 hour block between 4am and Noon. We have affectionately 
named this "spam hour" in the chat room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-average-time-to-delete.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Average Time to Deletion" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/spam-average-time-to-delete.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to delete spam quickly and accurately. The graph shows the time it takes for a reported spam post to be 
removed from the network. This section has three trend lines that show these averages. The first, red section is when 
we were simply reporting the posts to chatrooms and all flags had to come from users. You can see we are pretty constant 
in the time it takes to remove spam during this period. It took, on average, just over five minutes to get a post 
removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green trend line is when we were issuing a single automatic flag. At implementation, we eliminated a full minute 
from time to deletion and after a month we'd eliminated two full minutes compared to no automatic flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last section, the orange, is when we implemented three automatic flags to most sites. This was rolled out last 
week, but it's already had a dramatic improvement on the time to deletion. We are seeing between 1 and 2 minutes to 
time to deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, spam arrives in waves. The dashed and dotted lines on the graph show the average deletion time 
during these two different time periods. The dashed lines show deletion time during 4am and Noon UTC, the dotted lines 
show the rest of the 24 hour period. An interesting thing this graph shows is that time to deletion during spam hour 
was higher when we didn't cast any automatic flags. It was removed faster outside of spam hour. That reversed when we 
started issuing a single auto-flag. The spam hour time to deletion is slightly lower than the average. Comparing the 
two time periods though, time to deletion during non-spam hour at the end of the non-flagging time period and the end 
of the single flag period are roughly the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll update these in a few weeks too, to better show the trend we are seeing with three automatic flags.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="course"&gt;Course&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#course" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to squeeze one more course in before 2016 ended. This time I chose
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/from-0-1-machine-learning/learn/v4/overview"&gt;"From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase"&lt;/a&gt; by the LoonyCorn team on Udemy. This course was
a 20 hour overview of machine learning techniques. I've been interested in taking some more formal training on various
machine learning algorithms and this course sounded like it would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very disappointed in this course. The lessons had large portions of time that overlapped one another, the
background music was distracting, the instructor's speaking volume isn't consistent, the "coding" portions weren't
done in a way that allowed me to follow along, code was presented with bugs and the instructor glossed over
these with a simple "we'll fix those later". The theories were presented fairly well but really should have been
condensed into a handful of lessons instead of spread out so broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few lessons to realize it, but the course notes - effectively power point slides that are hand written
during the lecture - and the instructor's voice were recorded at different times. Multiple times through the lessons,
the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same portion is used repeatedly. Lecture notes are "rewritten" or explained again. This repetition is used
ineffectively, as the instructor's voice isn't consistent within a single lecture. The repeated parts are either much
louder or much softer than the surrounding lecture material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest disappointment, though, was with the coding exercises. I was hoping for some hands on activities. Instead,
the instructor spoke while the code - with all comments - was coded "live". The code was done quickly and offered no time
for me to both code and listen to the explanation. Like the lecture notes, the code and the vocal explanation was
recorded at different times. This means when a bug is encountered in the code, it is simply glossed over in the
explanation as an area they will return to later to fix. This was incredibly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course wasn't worth my time. The theory portions were &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; good enough that I stuck with it hoping to pick out
something useful, but it never seemed to materialize. I did complete the course and don't feel I've learned anything
that I can apply elsewhere. In the new year, I'll be looking for another machine learning course that, hopefully, is
much better than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a few years since I finished my formal education. I've been getting the itch to take a few more structured
training courses, but don't have the desire to commit to another full university degree. Fortunately, there are a lot
of places online that now offer training and college courses (both free and paid). I'll be picking out a few and going
through them as my free time permits. I'll be sharing my thoughts on the courses in a series of posts with a review of
the course and, if available, a link to show what I produced during the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-analysis-with-pandas"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#data-analysis-with-pandas" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/learn/v4/overview"&gt;Data Analysis with Pandas&lt;/a&gt; by Boris Paskhaver on Udemy. I use pandas both at work and in
personal projects and constantly find new things the library can do. This course is billed as a 19 hour course spanning
173 lectures. The curriculum looked like it covered both basics and topics I was less familiar with. It also helped
that the instructor was offering a coupon code on reddit to take the course for free. I decided to take the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler&lt;/em&gt;: Even if this wasn't free, this class was worth the price. It covered a large part of pandas and did so in a
way that didn't make me tune out the instructor, even after 19 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-lessons"&gt;Thoughts on the lessons&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-the-lessons" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course starts a bit slow with your basic "How to install" tutorials. The entire course is done in a series of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Data-Analysis-with-Pandas"&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; and, obviously, requires that you have Python (the instructor uses 3.5), pandas and a few
other modules installed before we get to the good stuff. The instructor uses OS X during all lectures, but that has
no effect on how things are communicated to the student. Everything is done in the Jupyter Notebooks or at a &lt;a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"&gt;conda&lt;/a&gt;
prompt. This works the same across all major operating systems. The only reason I felt this was slow was because I
already had all of the requirements installed due to using the library before. I understand the need for this lesson,
though, and can't hold it against the instructor for needing to include this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I liked about the introduction was that the instructor provided a series of CSV files we'd use
throughout the rest of the lessons. These CSVs were varied in size and composition. I thought this was a great way to
keep everyone on the same page. I've seen a lot of tutorials on pandas around the internet and most of them depend on
generating random data. By providing everyone with a set of CSVs it is much easier to focus on specific aspects of the
data and how certain functions work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="series-and-dataframes"&gt;Series and DataFrames&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#series-and-dataframes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course really begins in Section 2 which is on the pandas &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html"&gt;Series&lt;/a&gt; object. It covers what a series is, various
methods of creating one, and then goes over the various methods and attributes you can use on a series object. The
module covers 21 lessons and lays the foundation for the entire pandas library. Section 3, 4, and 5 cover
&lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html"&gt;DataFrames&lt;/a&gt;. These sections cover 41 lessons. DataFrames are the heart of the pandas library. This is the object
you'll use most of the time, which explains the number of lessons that focus on DataFrames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lessons cover everything from selecting a series (column) in a data frame, adding a new column, dropping null
values and sorting values. More advanced topics include various ways of filtering a dataframe to only the data you are
interested in, applying a function to all values and working with either index labels or index positions. These modules
are the heart of the entire course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="text-data-and-datetime-data"&gt;Text data and DateTime data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#text-data-and-datetime-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 6 and 10 deal with text data and datetime data. One complaint I had about these two sections was that they
were separated so much. Both types of data need to be operated on the same way in pandas. Namely, you have to add
either &lt;code&gt;.str&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.dt&lt;/code&gt; when calling a string or datetime function. I also think that datetimes are important enough
and used frequently enough that getting a lesson in on how to properly use them early would make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That complaint aside, both sections cover their content well. There isn't anything ground breaking here, especially
if you've done any sort of work with either strings or dates in Python. The functions introduced all work as you'd
expect based on that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DateTime section also provides information on how to work with date offsets and time deltas. Adding and
subtracting days/weeks/months is always important and the lessons cover how to do so pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="advanced-features"&gt;Advanced Features&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-features" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 7, 8 and 9 cover aspects of pandas that many will use as well. These cover ways to join and group multiple data
sets into a single data frame and the benefits of each method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MultiIndexes are not something I've used a lot, but after these 14 lessons I have already thought of ways I can
improve my code at work to utilize these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="panels"&gt;Panels&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#panels" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 11 covers a topic that was brand new to me: Panels. I have never used them or heard of them. A series is a 1D
data set, a dataframe is a 2D data set and a panel is a 3D data set. It is a group of dataframes. The instructor explained
this concept very clearly and worked through multiple examples of how to build and use a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, the panel we utilized was created by calling Google Finance for multiple companies. However, the panel
that was returned was not formatted the way I expected and it bothered me for several of the lessons. At first, this
was mentioned by the instructor in passing, and then seemed to be ignored. However, toward the end of the section, the
course covered ways of reforming the panel to be in a different format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="inputoutput-and-visualization"&gt;Input/Output and Visualization&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#inputoutput-and-visualization" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 12 and 13 covered the portions of pandas that my users see at work. The end result of data manipulation. I
produce visuals or excel documents and they are happy. The lessons cover how to export to CSVs and Excel (you need
an &lt;code&gt;ExcelWriter&lt;/code&gt;). It also covers the four most common visualizations I produce at my job - line charts, bar charts,
pie charts and histograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the scope of this course, but something I'll look into, is what else &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; can do. We did very
little to customize our plots and I know that the library can do so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="options"&gt;Options&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section covers a few of the miscellaneous options pandas has. There isn't anything exciting in this section
and these 4 lessons are short. Placing them at the end is a decent spot for them, as it reminds you to go look at the
documentation to see what other options are available (there are a ton).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I used a coupon code to take this course for free, I feel it was worth the listed price. The course covers 19
hours and 172 lessons. The may seem overwhelming at first, but the lessons are short, with most falling in the 4-7
minute range. There are a couple that reach the 10+ minute point, but they still held my attention the entire lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor has the lessons structured in a way that allows you to pause and return at the start of any lesson
without having to re-execute a long series of code. Most of the lessons are self contained, where a data set is either
re-imported at the start of each lesson or a new one is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only Section that didn't seem to follow this pattern was the visualization module. That module kept using code
from previous lessons. The section is less than an hour, but if you take a break you may need to rerun some of your
code in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 "quizzes" in this course. If you've worked through the lessons with the instructor, the questions are
very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now spent 19 hours (re)learning pandas and I feel that I've still just scratched the surface. I've learned a lot
that I'll be taking back to my code, but throughout the course I still got the impression there is much more to pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="notebooks"&gt;Notebooks&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#notebooks" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html"&gt;I ran for moderator&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;) on Stack Overflow and didn't make it through the primaries. I came 
close on that second run. Now, a year later, and a year more experienced, I'm going to try again. This post will 
document my progress through the election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert&lt;/em&gt;: I didn't win. The rest of this post details my thoughts as the election occured though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election this year took a slightly different route than last time. In previous years, the election was announced
at the same time as the call for nominations began. Users had a week to nominate themselves, then we answered a series
of community provided questions during the primaries, then the final election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the election was announced a week in advance of nominations. During the week, a call was put out for 
&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/337191/189134"&gt;Community questions&lt;/a&gt;. When a nomination was posted, the answers would be posted as well. This change was made due
to how much the community needed to read during the primaries. The primaries were only a few days long and the Q&amp;amp;As 
were usually ten questions for each user. When a primary has 20-30 nominees, that is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of reading that was 
expected in a short period of time. By bringing this phase forward, now the community has the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; election cycle
to read and interact with the nominees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I provided &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337238/189134"&gt;one question&lt;/a&gt; that was used in the final selection of questions. I mentioned &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; that I 
thought it was a great question, so I suggested it again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Meta posts that you're particularly proud of, or that you feel best demonstrate your moderation style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-nomination"&gt;My nomination&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-nomination" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/8?tab=nomination#post-40473869"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; isn't all the different than the last two times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, I'm &lt;strong&gt;Andy&lt;/strong&gt; and I'd like to be a moderator for you and Stack Overflow. I've answered the questions posted by the community &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337574/189134"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt; for over two years. I know the moderator tools and have worked with many of the current moderators. This interaction will continue as a new moderator here. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a lot of helpful flags. A decent percentage of these are on &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;, but not all. I'd like to help keep the site clean without adding to the current moderators' work load. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm active in the review queues (currently holding 5th in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/stats"&gt;Low Quality Post reviewers&lt;/a&gt; of all time), provide edits to posts, answers and enjoy the moderation aspect of Stack Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/"&gt;history on Meta.SO&lt;/a&gt; that shows I'm involved in the meta aspect of the site as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the moderation aspect on Stack Overflow (and Stack Exchange in general). I have a history of good community moderation, am here all the time and believe I can help the current team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first full day, I'm gotten positive responses to this post. My two favorite, so far, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy's work around comment flags has been very impressive. I'm definitely curious to see what his thoughts on the mod 
queue are and if we could incorporate some of his work permanently on the site. Better identification of flags is 
something that would be very nice to have permanently.  - &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/426671/bluefeet"&gt;bluefeet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stack Overflow Community Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always some nominees for this position who are very active, some who have good judgment and cool heads, and 
some who innovate with their approach to community moderation. Andy is the rare candidate who very clearly checks all 
three boxes. As a user on SO for 3.5 years, a moderator pro tempore on Engineering SE for 1.7 years and an early 
participant in the Community Building SE beta, I strongly support this nomination. - &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2359271/air"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://engineering.stackexchange.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderator on Engineering.SE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My candidate score this time is an impressive 39/40. This is up six from a year ago, and up ten from my first run. The
one missing point is due to missing the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4369/refiner"&gt;Refiner&lt;/a&gt; badge. I believe the reason for this is because of my workflow. I,
generally, don't edit and answer questions at the same time. If I'm answering, I'm not in "edit" mode. If I'm editting,
I'm usually in "moderation" mode. It's something I'll work on. I'm 38 out of 50 questions there, so I'll get it soon
enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="candidate-questions"&gt;Candidate questions&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#candidate-questions" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the questions were that surprising. With the added benefit of a week to prepare answers prior to nominating,
I am very pleased with my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337574/189134"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;. Two answers have generated a bit of discussion though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10k+ user regularly has their comments flagged as "rude or offensive" or "not constructive", to the tune of 
4-5 flags a day. No comment by itself is particularly offensive, but their general tone causes them to be flagged 
by multiple users. You've contacted them privately about this, but they believe that they aren't doing anything wrong 
and that people are being too sensitive. The flags keep coming in on their comments. What, if anything, do you do 
next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has an exemption from the Be Nice policy. I think the first step is to understand why nothing has already been 
done about the user. 4-5 a day seems like the user has moved beyond the "nuisance" stage. I think a temporary ban is 
appropriate, with another explanation as to what is expected when interacting with others. While some users are more 
sensitive than others, a stream of this many flags across an extended period of time doesn't lead me to believe the 
problem is with the community users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point raised in the comments was that I was rushing into banning the user without commuicating first. I disagree
with that, and explained that they've already been contacted privately and ignored those warnings. A ban is the next 
step in getting the user's attention. I was told this would be "humiliating" for a high rep user. Again, I disagree
and believe it's not humiliating, but &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/337571/2016-stack-overflow-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire/337574#comment411104_337574"&gt;educating&lt;/a&gt; the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question that generated some discussion was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You impose a temporary ban (say 1 week) on a user for what you judged as reasonable and valid reasons (the user 
gets notified by email of your action and the reason). The user replies to your email acknowledging the transgression,
says they won't do it again and asks for the ban to be lifted. The user sounds genuine. Do you remove the ban? Do you 
even reply at all? Explain your reasoning. The context of this question applies to longer bans too. If it helps get 
the juices flowing, consider the situation of a second offence for the same behaviour, which has a default ban 
period of 1 month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two answers for this question, based on the user's history. If this is a first offense, up to this point the 
user hasn't been pushing limits and attempting to disrupt others, and the ban isn't related to voting fraud, then I'd 
be willing to remove the ban. Sometimes a ban is put in place to get the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/288229/why-was-balusc-temporarily-suspended-from-so"&gt;user's attention&lt;/a&gt;. Once the situation 
has been resolved, the ban is no longer appropriate and should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the user has a history of crossing the line and looking for a reaction, or if the ban is 
related to vote fraud, I'd simply not reply and the user will return in a week. Stack Overflow has enough "voting 
irregularity" bans that I imagine the responses to such bans are all similar (and invalid). I see no reason to 
change that policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push back I recieved on this was that I was letting a user off the hook by unbanning them. I argued that unbanning
has been done in the past. Sometimes the ban is needed simply to get the user's attention and start the conversation
and explain that why they are doing is wrong. If the user abuses the trust at that point and repeats the behavior, then
the longer ban is completely justified. A bit of compassion isn't a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 12 nominees, so a primary will occur. Once again, the primary phase will reduce the number of candidates in
the final phase to 10. With so few being eliminated this time around, it feels a little unneeded. The primary will last 
for a few days and during that time users can vote candidates up or down depending whether they believe the nominee
should be a moderator. I'll return in a few days...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="primary-results"&gt;Primary Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Primary phase has ended and the final election has begun. I ended the primary in 5th place, securing a position 
in the final election. I have a sizable margin between my position and sixth place as well. One other stat that I'm
rather proud of: I received the fewest number of down votes of any candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Primary Results" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2016-Fall-SO-Primary-Results.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the election! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election-phase"&gt;Election Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election lasts for several days and covers a weekend. We'll see how it turns out in a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="election-results"&gt;Election Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the election has concluded. I didn't secure on of the three positions for moderator. I finished in &lt;a href="http://www.opavote.com/results/6488198410665984/0"&gt;5th place&lt;/a&gt;,
with my elimination propelling second and third place to a victory. I was eliminated in the 10th round of the Meek STV
process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to the new moderators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="post-election-thoughts"&gt;Post Election thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#post-election-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This election started differently than the previous two I've run in. This election was announced a week in advance
and solicited community input for questions for the candidates. I think this was a good change. The element of 
surprise in the previous two made it much more stressful. Additionally, by having the questions available at the start
of the election - instead of at the start of the primary phase - I was able to better answer the questions. Previously,
the questions would be available at the start of the primary phase. With the amount of reading needed to get through
one candidate's answers, let alone all of them, I imagine that many people didn't read all of the responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other nice thing about this lead time, is that I had time to get my answers read for when I posted my nomination. 
By posting the questions and answers at the same time, I was able to have my responses available the entire time. 
Score-wise, on the questionnaire, I did much better than my opponents. I think a big reason for this is that I have my
responses posted as soon as my nomination was posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question this time, though, seemed to split the candidates. I mentioned it previously, but it was regarding 
potentially removing a temporary ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You impose a temporary ban (say 1 week) on a user for what you judged as reasonable and valid reasons (the user 
gets notified by email of your action and the reason). The user replies to your email acknowledging the transgression,
says they won't do it again and asks for the ban to be lifted. The user sounds genuine. Do you remove the ban? Do you 
even reply at all? Explain your reasoning. The context of this question applies to longer bans too. If it helps get 
the juices flowing, consider the situation of a second offence for the same behaviour, which has a default ban 
period of 1 month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of two candidates that explicitly stated we'd consider removing the ban. A third user didn't state it 
explicitly, but did say they'd consider it. I was surprised by the harsh tone the others took, especially since there
is a lot of previous discussions on Meta where the outcome is the moderators or community managers removing the ban. I 
was happy to see that the other candidate who said they'd consider removing the ban get elected though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still believe that removing the ban is a valid option. Especially because their &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; ban would be much longer if 
they broke my trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see when the next election on Stack Overflow is, but with three new moderators and no resignations, I suspect
it'll be a while. I'll consider running again then. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>My experiences releasing a package to PyPI</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/my-experiences-releasing-a-package-to-pypi.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2016-03-15T12:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-03-15T12:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2016-03-15:/my-experiences-releasing-a-package-to-pypi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I released StackAPI to PyPI. This post talks about my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of my &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;other projects&lt;/a&gt;, I've needed to make extensive use of the Stack Exchange API. I built a small library - StackAPI - to assist in this task and released it on Python's &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/StackAPI"&gt;PyPI repository&lt;/a&gt;. This post is going to cover some of the technical decisions and issues I ran into while going through this process. This was my first project being released to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals when releasing this were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up my own code so that it is usable by others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the documentation and host the documentation on &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically release it to PyPI, if it passes basic tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those goals sound simple. In the future, they probably will be, but for this first release it wasn't as simple as I was hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="project-layout"&gt;Project Layout&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#project-layout" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this project, I'd written modules and libraries that were used by myself (for personal projects) or as part of a larger application (for work). In both cases, though, I had a directory structure that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/project_root
    /mymodule
        __init__.py
        mymodule.py
    __init__.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was close to the end goal, but lacked some files in the &lt;code&gt;project_root&lt;/code&gt; that were needed for a proper install via &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;. The important file that was missing was &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;. I needed this file to ensure that everything would install with a simple &lt;code&gt;pip install stackapi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="setuppy"&gt;setup.py&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#setuppy" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/setup.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is pretty basic and available on GitHub. There are a couple important things though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;: This is needed, but I didn't want to have to constantly remember to update this when pushing a version to PyPI. This was one of my first criteria when starting the project. I wanted to automate as much as I could, and versioning was at the top of that list. It's small, but easy to forget and keep syncronized across all the files in the project. I decided to utilize &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion"&gt;bumpversion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fabfile.org/"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; to manage this specific field (both here and elsewhere in the project).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_requires&lt;/code&gt;: StackAPI is built in the fantastic &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; library. To ensure this was installed when StackAPI was install, it was needed in this field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tests_require&lt;/code&gt;: The test suite I build utilizes the &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; library. I don't want that to be installed if the developer isn't running the tests, so it is added to this field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_suite&lt;/code&gt;: I wanted developers to be able to run &lt;code&gt;python setup.py test&lt;/code&gt; to execute the test suite. To do so, I had to point to the where the tests were being executed from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; seemed to be fairly standard when compared to other Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bumpversion-and-fabric"&gt;Bumpversion and Fabric&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#bumpversion-and-fabric" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I wanted to automate any versioning that was required. To do so, I used the &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion"&gt;bumpversion&lt;/a&gt; library and wrote a small &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/fabfile.py"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; script to handle it automatically. &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; uses a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/setup.cfg"&gt;config file&lt;/a&gt;, to determine what it is going to do. I configured it to automatically create a commit and a new git tag for each version. I then pointed to a couple files where the current version is listed. When &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it will change the version in each of those files to the new version. It will then create a single commit to the git repository with a commit message similar to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bump version: 0.1.6 â 0.1.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is nice and clean. It tags the commit for me, which is useful later, when I want to push the change to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make running &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; a bit easier, I utilized a Fabric routine I found &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jbarratt/85c91d7b904462702892"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; and adjusted it for my purposes. When I run &lt;code&gt;fab release&lt;/code&gt;, all of the &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; 'stuff' occurs. Then I just have to push the commit (and new tag) to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="final-project-layout"&gt;Final Project Layout&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-project-layout" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final project layout I settled on was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/stackapi
    /docs
        ...
    /stackapi
        __init__.py
        stackapi.py
    /tests
    .gitignore
    .travis.yml
    fabfile.py
    setup.cfg
    setup.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="read-the-docs"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#read-the-docs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="configure-the-project"&gt;Configure the project&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#configure-the-project" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final project layout, you can see there is a &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory. One of my goals was to make this library usable and understandable by other developers. A good part of that means having decent documentation. I spent way more time than I expected cleaning the documentation in the code and creating documentation with examples. Most of that time was spent learning the sphinx documentation style and ReStructuredText, which Read the Docs utilizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in this process was installing and setting up the initial configuration for the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I created the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory and switched to it and ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sphinx-quickstart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts a short, interactive, wizard. Fill out the questions. At the end of this, it creates a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/docs/conf.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory. The rest of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/tree/master/docs"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is ReStructuredText files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how the documentation looks, from the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;make html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a &lt;code&gt;_build&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you open &lt;code&gt;_build/html/index.html&lt;/code&gt;, the documentation can be browsed locally. I do not commit this directory to git, though. It is ignored in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;, as a user can regenerate it at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="configure-read-the-docs"&gt;Configure Read the Docs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#configure-read-the-docs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was satisfied with how the documentation looked, I had to configure Read the Docs to read my GitHub repository. To repeat those steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up (or log in) at &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt; (part of this will be associating the account to a GitHub account)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit your &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and click "Import a project"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the form, but in my case the defaults were all appropriate. Do note that URLs are case sensitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "Create". This is the first version of your documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep the code updating as you update GitHub, log into GitHub and go to the repository's "Settings" page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "Webhooks &amp;amp; Services"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click "Add Service"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "ReadTheDocs" and add the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, each time you push a change to the repository, a new set of documents will be built. I then added the Read the Docs badge to my &lt;code&gt;README.rst&lt;/code&gt; for a simple link to the detailed documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; https://readthedocs.org/projects/stackapi/badge/?version=latest
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;:target:&lt;/span&gt; http://stackapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;:alt:&lt;/span&gt; Documentation Status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="force-rebuild-of-docs"&gt;Force rebuild of docs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#force-rebuild-of-docs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the very end of this project, Read the Docs had a minor hiccup and failed on building my documentation. I didn't want to force a build by making a fake commit. Instead, Read the Docs provides the information needed to force a rebuild. It requires a very simple &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; to the Post Commit Hook they provide. In my case, this was as simple as running this command (provided from the Dashboard):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X POST https://readthedocs.org/build/stackapi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pypi"&gt;PyPI&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pypi" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of the journey, it was time to see what exactly PyPI required. The first step was setting up an account on both the Test and Production instances of PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PiPY Test: http://testpypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyPI Live: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having one on both was important while testing. It meant that I didn't have to send broken versions to the live PyPI server, and I could adjust ReStructuredText formatting issues without requiring another release to PyPI. Each time a version is pushed to PyPI it &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have a new version number. By using the test instance, I could use as many of these fake versions as needed to fix things. Hooray for test environments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we perform this step automatically, we need to test that the PyPI accounts work. By following portions of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/.travis.yml"&gt;"First Time with PyPI"&lt;/a&gt; tutorial, I focused by steps down to these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.pypirc&lt;/code&gt; file in your home directory - not your project directory. This won't be required once Travis CI is set up and configured, so having the passwords in this, temporarily, wasn't an issue because I eventually deleted the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[distutils]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;index-servers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;pypi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;pypitest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[pypi]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_username&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_password&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[pypitest]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://testpypi.python.org/pypi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_username&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your_password&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the package on PyPI Test: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypitest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the package on PyPI Live: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the project to Test: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypitest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the project to Live, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you're ready for your first release. Remember, once a version is released to PyPI, it can't be used again (or overwritten): &lt;code&gt;python setup.py register -r pypi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of the above passed to your satisfaction, you can remove the &lt;code&gt;.pypirc&lt;/code&gt; file and move on to configuring Travis CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="travis"&gt;Travis&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#travis" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step in this process will be using Travis CI to perform some basic tests and, if this was a new release, push the changes to PyPI. The Travis config file is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi/blob/master/.travis.yml"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to support 'modern' Python with this library. I've configured Travis to test against multiple versions of Python, ranging from 2.7 to 3.5. StackAPI is installed using &lt;code&gt;python setup.py -q install&lt;/code&gt;. Then the test suite is run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important bits are in the &lt;code&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a new git tag pushed to GitHub, and the tests pass, Travis CI will push the code to PyPI. Since &lt;code&gt;bumpversion&lt;/code&gt; makes a new git tag with each new version, this works perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does require that my password be included in the yml file. To keep this secure, I utilized the &lt;a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-01-14-new-client/"&gt;Travis Command Line Client&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;gem install travis&lt;/code&gt;). In my local directory, I then ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;travis encrypt --add deploy.password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This added the password to the YML file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I've released something to PyPI. It took a lot more set up than I expected it would take. However, now that I've gone through the process, gotten used to the ReStructuredText format that Sphinx and Read the Docs require, and set up PyPI for one project, I think it'll be fairly simple to do in the future. Most of the work is getting the other services to talk with GitHub and practicing good developer habits (documentation...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="all-stackapi-links"&gt;All StackAPI Links&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#all-stackapi-links" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these links are to the various places that StackAPI lives on the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt;: http://stackapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TravisCI&lt;/strong&gt;: https://travis-ci.org/AWegnerGitHub/stackapi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyPI&lt;/strong&gt;: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/StackAPI&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; Vipers early this year, I've been itching to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; web related. Web technologies aren't my best technical skill, but I like trying out new things and learning something in the process. I use Python at work. I like Python a lot. With Christmas and New Years coming up, I want to have a project during my down time. My goal is to get a &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; application built and then deployed to &lt;a href="https://www.openshift.com/"&gt;OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;. Part of this deployment is to utilize &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;TravisCI&lt;/a&gt;. I'm planning on using &lt;a href="http://pytest.org/latest/"&gt;pytest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; for my test suite. Finally, I want to use my own (sub)domain, instead of the provided &lt;code&gt;rhcloud&lt;/code&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these three technologies, I've used only Flask before. The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html"&gt;comment flagging bot&lt;/a&gt; I built has a dashboard built in Flask. I've never used OpenShift or TravisCI. I selected OpenShift because it has a couple features I want that Heroku doesn't. The biggest one, was that OpenShift has support for MySQL and Heroku doesn't (surprisingly). I want to use TravisCI and automated testing, because one of my goals for next year at work is to introduce automated tested to our development. (I work with Engineers, not coders...that's my excuse and it's a bad excuse, so I'm going to try and fix it.) To get ready for that goal, I want to test out a system that does continuous integration/automated testing. Both OpenShift and Travis CI provide me with free services. Hypothesis and py.test provide me with a way to generate comprehensive test conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="openshift-set-up"&gt;OpenShift set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#openshift-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing up for OpenShift was easy. Fill out the form, provide an email address - though they don't like email addresses with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; signs, which is disappointing - and then click the link they email back to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;code&gt;rhc&lt;/code&gt; OpenShift client tools are needed. This is a Ruby package. I have no experience with Ruby, so I needed to install Ruby as well. I ran into a problem almost immediately. The &lt;a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for installing these tools says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenShift rhc can be run on any operating system with Ruby 1.8.7 or higher assuming you have the requisite user permissions to install programs. Instructions for specific operating systems are provided below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on that, I figured I'd install the latest version of &lt;a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I tested this, that was 2.2.3. Unfortunately, when I ran the command to install the &lt;code&gt;rhc&lt;/code&gt; tools, I received an error. After a bit of Googling, I found that it doesn't like 2.2x. So, I installed 2.1.7 instead. Next, I ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install rhc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This installs several gems and took a few minutes to complete. Next,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rhc setup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started the OpenShift setup wizard. It consisted of filling out the few prompts and letting it generate an SSH key and then connecting to my account. Remember the Namespace you select. Again, this took a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="flask-setup"&gt;Flask setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#flask-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to set up my first "Gear". This would be the Flask application. I'll work on the database next. First, I just want Python and Flask to function properly. Fortunately, this is very easy, as OpenShift has a Flask template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rhc app create testapp python-2.7 --from-code=https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/flask-base.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am utilizing Python 2.7, because that is the recommendation from the Flask team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;testapp&lt;/code&gt; can be any alphanumeric string. This is the name that will appear in the Web Console. A specific note, &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is not alphanumeric. I'm getting the feeling that OpenShift doesn't like "special" characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--from-code&lt;/code&gt; parameter will download that repository and use it as the base of your application. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Flask can be run locally using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;python app.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application can be pushed back to OpenShift at this point and there should be a functional page on your OpenShift domain. In your command line, from the directory of your project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add --all
git commit -m "Adding Flask application"
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will take a moment. At the end, you should see these lines in your command prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Receive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Deployment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all three are a success, then you should be able to visit your URL. Your URL is a combination of your selected Namespace and the application name you created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;testapp&amp;gt;.rhcloud.com/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should show a "Welcome to Flask on OpenShift" page. If you append &lt;code&gt;/test&lt;/code&gt; to your URL, you'll get a message that says "It's Alive!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't, you can check your error logs by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rhc tail -a &amp;lt;testapp&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mysql-setup"&gt;MySQL setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mysql-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I set up my application to utilize MySQL. It's the database I have the most experience with, so I decided to keep that aspect of this project simple for myself. The first step was to add a MySQL 5.5 cartridge to my test gear (OpenShift terminology). I did this in the OpenShift web console. The UI provided me with the option to install various databases and one of those was MySQL. Clicking the link caused a few second delay as it was set up, and then I was presented with login credentials to my database. Step one...done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is installing the correct Python modules to utilize MySQL. I selected &lt;a href="http://www.pymysql.org/"&gt;PyMySQL&lt;/a&gt; (again, experience) and &lt;a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt;. I added these to both &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;. The idea behind doing it in both places is to make life easy for myself in the future. Additionally, the quick tutorials I've looked at for TravisCI encourage the usage of &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;, while it seems OpenShift uses the &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;. I'll fix that eventually, but getting it set up initially, this will be fastest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add these to &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlalchemy==1.0.9
pymysql==0.6.7
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this to the &lt;code&gt;install_requires&lt;/code&gt; list in &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;'sqlalchemy==1.0.9','pymysql==0.6.7','Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about OpenShift is that the credentials to the database are placed in &lt;a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-environment-variables.html#database-variables"&gt;environment variables&lt;/a&gt;, so I don't need to embed the passwords, connections strings, or anything potentially sensitive in my code. For MySQL these are available as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Purpose&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listening&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;administrative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;administrative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_SOCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;An&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connecting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;non&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scaled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="utilizing-the-database"&gt;Utilizing the database&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#utilizing-the-database" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up SQLAlchemy and MySQL is fairly easy. I tested this with a simple table and ensured that it appeared in the database as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;):
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__tablename__&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="s"&gt;'users'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="s"&gt;'user_id'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="n"&gt;primary_key&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class="nb"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few adjustments were made to the import statements of the Flask application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask_sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple variables were created and loaded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.config.from_pyfile('flaskapp.cfg')
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;flaskapp.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file was modified to include these two lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL'] + os.environ['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME]
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="remote-mysql-access"&gt;Remote MySQL Access&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#remote-mysql-access" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to use &lt;a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/"&gt;MySQL Workbench&lt;/a&gt; while building and testing to watch what's happening in the database. To use that with OpenShift, I had to jump through a few small hoops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the connection a name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In "Connection Method", select "Standard TCP/IP over SSH"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SSH Hostname is the full name of your OpenShift gear where MySQL is installed. It should look like &lt;code&gt;namespace-appname.rhcloud.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SSH Username is the gear's Unique Identifier. This can be found by looking at the &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. It can also be found in the web console, but looking at the "remote access" section. It shows a connection string. You need the username portion. This is the part that appears before the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;ssh longuniquestring@namespace-appname.rhcloud.com&lt;/code&gt; command. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the SSH key file. On Windows this is in &lt;code&gt;\Users\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\.ssh\id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set MySQL Hostname equal to the value in &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Username equal to the value in &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt; (this was also provided to you when you installed MySQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Password equal to the value in &lt;code&gt;OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; (again, this was provided to you when MySQL was installed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="travisci-setup"&gt;TravisCI setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#travisci-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to play with automated testing. The idea behind this is to get a jump start on a goal for next year at work and to learn something new. I'd like to utilize Travis CI to perform the tests and if they pass, deploy to OpenShift. If the tests fail, I don't want to push a broken build to OpenShift. That's the goal...we'll see how it turns out. But, the first step is getting Travis CI and OpenShift talking to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis CI integrates with GitHub, so what I'm going to do in reality is push to GitHub and let Travis CI pick up the changes. From there, it will perform it's tests. If the tests pass, it will push the commit to OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On GitHub, create a new repository for your source. This is where you will be pushing your code for Travis CI to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your OpenShift directory (which is already a git repository):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote rename origin openshift
git remote add origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;USER&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;repositoryname&amp;gt;.git
git push -u origin master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resets the origin to point to your new GitHub repository and sets up a new remote. Then it pushes the changes to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log into your &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile"&gt;Travis CI profile page&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you are logged into GitHub first, as this will create the profile automatically. Press the "Sync now" button at the top of the page to pull a list of all of your repositories. Once that is done, find the repository you just set up, and enable integration with that repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you need to set up Travis CI and the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install travis
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will install a Ruby script that assists in this process. If you get an error when running this, you need to create an empty &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file first and then run the command again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;travis setup openshift
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out the prompts. Defaults should be fine in most cases, but do pay attention to "OpenShift application name". If your GitHub repository is named differently than your OpenShift application name, the default for this prompt will be incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last note, for a quick test you can change the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; section to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forces the tests to pass. Once you've written tests, you can do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;script:
    - py.test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will run your test scripts, utilizing &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy these changes to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .travis.yml
git commit -m "Deploying Travis"
git push origin master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will commit and push the changes to GitHub. A few seconds later, if you are watching Travis CI, you'll see it notices the new commit and starts running tests. If you tests complete with a status code of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (successful), it will deploy the changes to OpenShift. If the tests fail (any other status code), it will not deploy to OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pytest-setup"&gt;py.test setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pytest-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up the testing frame work involves a few Python modules. These need to be added to both &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pytest&amp;gt;=2.8.0
hypothesis==1.16.0
pytest-runner==2.6.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is setting up some quick integration with &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, so that users can run &lt;code&gt;python setup.py test&lt;/code&gt; and execute your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, add (or edit) the &lt;code&gt;setup_requires&lt;/code&gt; list to include &lt;code&gt;pytest-runner&lt;/code&gt;. Add (or edit) the &lt;code&gt;tests_require&lt;/code&gt; list to include &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;. I also added the following to my &lt;code&gt;setup.cfg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[aliases]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I modified my &lt;code&gt;setup_requires&lt;/code&gt; list a bit, so that it's conditional. Since this would install the &lt;code&gt;pytest-runner&lt;/code&gt; on every call to &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, even when the module wouldn't be called, I wanted the runner to only be required when &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; is utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;needs_pytest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pytest'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'test'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ptr'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;intersection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest_runner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pytest-runner'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;needs_pytest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup_requires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#... Other requirements here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest_runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to test that my tests were working correctly. I created a &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; directory, which is where I plan on storing all of my test cases. &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; will find any files that start or end with &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; and execute them. I created a very simple &lt;code&gt;test_tests.py&lt;/code&gt; file with the following simple test (taken from the &lt;a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#writing-tests"&gt;Hypothesis Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@given&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;integers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;integers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_ints_are_commutative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Travis CI needs to be told what to do. Modify the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; key to include &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;script:
   - py.test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a successful run through Travis, you'll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;tests/test_tests.py .
=========================== 1 passed in 0.26 seconds ===========================
The command "py.test" exited with 0.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="custom-domain"&gt;Custom Domain&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#custom-domain" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my own domain name. I want to utilize OpenShift with one of those domains, instead of the default one provided. Since I've using the free tier, that will rule out using the SSL certificate that is wildcarded to the whole &lt;code&gt;rhcloud.com&lt;/code&gt; domain. I can live with this. If I need SSL on my domain, I'll upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up OpenShift to use your domain, log into the web console. Go to the gear you are configuring. At the top, where the full domain is displayed, is the option to "Change". Select that option. Input the full domain (and subdomain) you want to utilize and click "Save". After a few seconds, you'll get a notification that the alias was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to configure the DNS records. I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html"&gt;utilize&lt;/a&gt; CloudFlare for my domains, so the instructs will be specific to that, but should apply to any DNS system. Login to your management system and go to the area where you can specify DNS records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my test, I set up a subdomain of one of my domains as the alias I wanted to use. In your DNS system, set up a CNAME that points to the original hostname on OpenShift. The CNAME should be the subdomain you told OpenShift about. Save the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFlare recognized this immediately and redirected me to my Flask application. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, the set up is complete. You have a Flask application, connected to MySQL, that is integrated with a CI system which automatically deploys to OpenShift when all tests pass and uses CloudFlare (because I already was doing so), to provide a CDN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to building something!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>I'm running for moderator on Stack Overflow again</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-11-18T09:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-12-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-11-18:/i'm-running-for-moderator-on-stack-overflow-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow is having a second election this year.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html"&gt;I ran for moderator&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow and didn't make it through the primaries. That's ok though, there were several very good users that did get &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/6"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt;. In a surprise announcement, though, Stack Overflow is running a second election this year. This is the first time this has happened since 2011. I'm still interested in a position and I'm still active in the community, so I'm going to run again. This post will follow the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last time, the nomination phase began with users throwing their hat into the ring. Nominations were slower and fewer this time. Only 19 nominees, so no one was eliminated due to low reputation. Several users from the last election are rerunning too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-platform"&gt;My Platform&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-platform" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/7#post-33617646"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; hasn't changed much since the previous run. Below is my nomination post. This time, I tried to pull emphasis off the automated script by putting it lower on the list of things I've done and instead focused on the moderation tasks I do on Stack Overflow and the work I've done on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;. We'll see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, I'm &lt;strong&gt;Andy&lt;/strong&gt; and I'd make a great moderator for Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-vote-for-me"&gt;Why vote for me?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-vote-for-me" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm active in the review queues (currently holding 10th in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/stats"&gt;Low Quality Post reviewers&lt;/a&gt; of all time), provide edits to posts, &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=answers"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the moderation aspect of Stack Exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;CommunityBuilding&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a year and a half. I know the moderator tools and have worked with several of the current moderators. This interaction will continue as a new moderator here. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've built an automated script that continues to handle &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;noisy comments&lt;/a&gt; very &lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GK32p.png"&gt;accurately&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; on Meta.SO that shows I'm involved in the meta aspect of the site as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a history of good community moderation already. I enjoy the moderation aspect on Stack Overflow (and Stack Exchange in general). I deal with users with respect, even if our opinions on an issue differ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I received my "candidate score". It was 33/40. Not the highest, but better than last time. The score wasn't mentioned in April. I am not expecting it to be an issue this time either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/november_2015_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated November 21, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary phase is in the third day. In day 1, I was hovering around 9th/10th place. Overnight, between days 1 and 2 though, I dropped down to 11th. I've been sitting here consistantly for a full day now and, while still gaining votes, I'm not gaining as fast as 10th position. It appears I may not make the cutoff by Friday's deadline. While disappointing, there are a few things that I came away with that I'm very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last primary, I revieved 1,492 positive votes. I've surpassed that already. I've over 2,100 currently. I'm pleased with that upswing. I was also more prepared for the questionnaire portion of the primaries this time. I've gotten the second highest number of upvotes on my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/310357/189134"&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the questions were similar to last time, but there are a few that I think should be included in the future elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="questionnaire"&gt;Questionnaire&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#questionnaire" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first question is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; post for candidates. It allows them to show off their involvement in Meta and show their best work. For users, it gives them a sense of how a candidate interacts with the community. I am very surprised that several candidates list only one or two posts. This seems to be doing a disservice to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Meta posts that you're particularly proud of, or that you feel best demonstrate your moderation style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm proud of several of my posts both here on Meta.SO and on other network sites I participate in. Here on MSO, I have two questions that I am proud of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;Can a machine be taught to flag comments automatically?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them"&gt;I estimate 10% of the links posted here are dead. How do we deal with them?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these, you can see that I care about quality on Stack Overflow. I've spent time analyzing the problem, as I see it, and present my findings to the community. I participated in the discussions that both posts generated and &lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQoP5.png"&gt;continue to run&lt;/a&gt; the bot to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on the network, my participation in meta has helped to shape communities. For example, on &lt;a href="http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com"&gt;Hardware Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, my meta post about &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/81/57"&gt;"What type of hardware is allowed"&lt;/a&gt; helped to set the scope of what the community accepts as on topic hardware. I've also helped to set up the &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/206/57"&gt;high quality guidelines for questions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/274/57"&gt;argued against certain types of tags&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/257/57"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these, I've presented my arguments and logic and strived to remain professional. I believe the community on HardwareRecs has seen that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a moderator on &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;, I've been involved in many &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/users/78/andy?tab=summary"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;. I was involved in the discussions to &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/175/78"&gt;rename&lt;/a&gt; the community from Moderators.SE to CommunityBuilding.SE. I've been involved in discussions about slow &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/151/78"&gt;growth of the community&lt;/a&gt;. I've also presented &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/1274/78"&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; that go against other moderators, and walked away still feeling like a moderation team. (Go communication!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on OpenSource, I made a &lt;a href="http://meta.opensource.stackexchange.com/q/642/22"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how moderators had implemented a policy to watch the reviewers. It was similar to the long removed "flag weight" option that used to exist. I believe the post was presented in a way that questioned the decisions of the moderators, yet remained professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these meta posts, across the network, I think you can pick up on my moderation style and personality. I like data and I try to present my thoughts in a way that is understandable to all. I'm also willing to speak my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second question I struggled with for a bit. I've had ideas on how Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange could improve, but what did I want to present in this response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could add/revise one Stack Overflow policy/guideline, what would you change? Why would you change it, and what would it mean for the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to this question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of talking myself out of a position, I think more community moderation would help the problem that Stack Overflow has with scaling moderators. There are a couple areas that I think would work well in opening this to the higher reputation users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment flagging: Comments can be removed if enough users flag a comment. If not, a moderator needs to handle the flag. Instead, opening this as a review queue can remove a lot of this burden from the moderators. Users could handle all but the "Other..." flag. There may be guidance needed on the "Obsolete" one due to the difference between "obsolete comment" and "obsolete code block" differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audit Review reviews: On Stack Overflow, we get a decent number of &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/disputed-review-audits"&gt;disputed audit review&lt;/a&gt; posts on meta. There may be a way to get users with a history of passing both audits and good reviews involved in dealing with these disputed audits. The idea would be to say whether an audit is good or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes, and other areas where the community could be leveraged for moderation tasks, helps to remove the burden on moderators. Handling 2,000 (and growing) flags a day means that something needs to change. Moderators are exception handlers. They should be handling the cases that are exceptional - not comments that are no longer relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the community, this would be more &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252844/make-comment-flags-less-stupid"&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; with the moderation aspect. Users would be able to more quickly clean up a comment thread. Flag it and it appears in the review queue. From here, the moderators don't need to be involved. The downside of this is that it adds another queue for users to be involved with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="primary-results"&gt;Primary Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the primaries over, I ended with &lt;strong&gt;2483&lt;/strong&gt; positive votes. This put me in 11th place. Sadly, this was not enough to get into the election. I was 185 votes shy of over taking 10th. Good luck to the candidates that made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Live Vote Counter at the end of the Primary" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2015-11-21_22_43_25-SO_2015_Election_Vote_Monitor.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tools that came out of this election was a way to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310694/189134"&gt;visualize&lt;/a&gt; various data points to compare candidates. I provided a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/310736/189134"&gt;couple notes about outliers&lt;/a&gt; various candidates show regarding aspects on the site. I found it interesting to see what each user had "specialized" in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election"&gt;Election&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated December 8, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election is over and the new moderators have settled in. We've had our first bout of public drama over one of these moderators actually moderating a chat room too. &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was closer to the top 10 this time, but still missed it. Even more surprising was that the user that ended up in 3rd in the primaries didn't even come close to getting elected. He was eliminated in the 5th round of final STV votes. I still think I'd make a great moderator for Stack Overflow, but I need to figure out the best way to promote myself in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>How not to recruit me</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-not-to-recruit-me.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-10-10T14:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-10-10T14:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-10-10:/how-not-to-recruit-me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In which I discuss ways not to send me a recruitment message if you are interested in me working for you&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, on Meta.StackOverflow, a product manager &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/307674/189134"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for feedback on how they could make first contact between employers and potential employees more valuable to the potential employee. I provided my &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/307687/189134"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;. I've reposted it below, with some minor changes to further explain my ideals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary of this entire post is: If I have to spend time to make my resume jump out and catch &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; attention, I expect you to spend just a little bit of time telling me about your company and the position you are recruiting for. I don't think a few sentences with these details is that much ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-i-want-to-see"&gt;What I want to see&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-i-want-to-see" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know what the company does and I want to know who you are. I also want to know what positions you are looking to fill and a few details about the position are also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="messages-ive-recieved"&gt;Messages I've recieved&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#messages-ive-recieved" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-1"&gt;Message 1&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the start of a good message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 1" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/message1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has the following good elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who the recruiter is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position they are recruiting for &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not offer the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the company does (other than "build great software").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation which of my skills or experiences they are interested in. Are you interested in my Python answers on Stack Overflow? My projects on Github? My PHP experience from years ago? This is &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; to know. If the company is looking to recruit me for knowledge I shared years ago (ie. PHP in my case), I'd probably be less useful right now because I haven't used PHP in years. I have not kept up with recent changes to the language or various frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation of what the position will do, projects I'll be involved in, or challenges they are facing now that I'll help solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not respond to this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-2"&gt;Message 2&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-2" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 2" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/message2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the following useful elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know your name, position and company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to who the company was in this particular message, I am even vaguely aware of what the company does. Name recognition helps, but is not very high on my list of &lt;em&gt;"important things"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does not have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of the position. "Looking for top talent...to make a significant impact on our systems". Ok. How? What will I be doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you find me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually talked to this recruiter and I have to say that I'm both disappointed in the company and myself for not noticing some red flags in this message. This wasn't an interview for a specific position. This was a general recruiting email and I suspect it was sent to multiple users. Flags that I missed in the message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of any details at all and use of buzzwords ("top technical talent", "fast paced", "start-up like", "eCommerce industry").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion about personal career goals and technical background. Some of my back ground should be obvious from my Careers profile, SO profile and links on both. More importantly, I missed the "personal career goals" flag. The details they wanted were to see if my goals aligned with any open positions they had at the time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the discussion took place, the recruiter knew little more than my name. There were no questions about my careers profile (at the very least) or other projects I mentioned on my profile. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-3"&gt;Message 3&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-3" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 3" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/message3.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message isn't useful to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is this company and what do they do? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no experience in mobile apps. How did they find me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Chad's relationship to the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this message showed up because I work for one of their largest clients, live 10 miles from their office and work, literally, right across the street from them. I didn't know that at the time though. I had to ask a co-worker if they'd ever heard of the company. They pointed out their office at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not respond this this message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="message-4"&gt;Message 4&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#message-4" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message 4" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/message4.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message is worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are seeking employees who are willing to relocate. Great. Good for you. Are you interested in my skills or just a warm body to keep your chairs warm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No details about the company, other than a link to a web site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No name at all. Who am I talking to? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No details about the job. I hope they found someone to hold their seats to the floor 8 hours a day. If not, I recommend large rocks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-the-messages"&gt;Summary of the messages&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-the-messages" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need &lt;em&gt;details&lt;/em&gt; and I need details more than what the salary is going to be. Obviously, I need to do some research about your company, if I've never heard of you. But, throw me a bone. Tell me a bit about your self. I had to make a fancy resume to get you to reach out to me. I did something that caught your eye. Now, do something that will catch mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't need to work at a company that is the next Google or Apple or start up flush with cash. But, I do want to know about the company before I talk to you. If you can't spend a few seconds explaining a bit about the company, I don't want to talk with you. I don't think a few sentences is that much to offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here at COMPANY NAME, we are looking for a POSITION with skills in LANGUAGE or experience in INDUSTRY. I see you have both and think you'd be able to help TEAM NAME with their on going project of MAKING THE WORLD BETTER. Your PROJECT ON GITHUB looks like you've dealt with aspects of this problem before. We've gotten some press recently about our innovations in this area (check them out HERE)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-my-attention"&gt;How to get my attention&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-my-attention" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the post above makes it clear what &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work. The companies that I've responded to (other than message 2, above) have all done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicate they've at least looked at my resume by commenting on some aspect of it. I've had recruiters mention projects I've done, jobs I've held, or individual bullet points that caught their attention. This is great. It means you aren't reaching out to me because I happened to hit all of your keywords when the resume passed through your Human Resources department.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a short description of the job they want to fill. I don't need a full job posting. A link to such a posting is sufficient. However, if you could summarize it in a sentence or two, that'd make both of our lives easier. Reading full job descriptions isn't the most fun thing in the world and often have industry (or even company) specific acronyms. That isn't helpful to either of us, because I may not know them. Just tell me what your team does within the company. That's good enough to get my attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to me like a person, not some number that a database search returned. As a hint, if you can figure out that I like to go by "Andy", instead of "Andrew", you've already done a far better job than most recruiters I've spoken with. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last two posts, I've discussed the number of &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;rotten links&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow and a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;proposal to fix said links&lt;/a&gt;.

I loaded the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;a href="https://mariadb.org/"&gt;MariaDB&lt;/a&gt; instance on my local machine. This was accomplished with a very simple script and patience, as the script took a while to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;infile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/path/to/posts.xml'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;identified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;row&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-data"&gt;The data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, the next step was selecting my random sample of data. I did this by randomly selecting 25% of the days in a year and then pulling all posts for those days across all years of Stack Overflow's existence. The Python script I used to do this was fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;random_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;total_seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;366&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dayslist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xrange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dayslist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this run, the days that I cared about are in the &lt;code&gt;dayslist&lt;/code&gt; variable. I used that to pull questions and answers from the database that were created on that month/day combination. In the end, this resulted in just over 25% of the total posts being selected. To ensure that I could replicate the results, I also saved the dates that were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="parsing-the-data"&gt;Parsing the data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#parsing-the-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to parse out links from the data. I used the following script to extract anchor text and links from a post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;links_in_post(post):
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;"""
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Returns&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;links&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;found
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;:param&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;posts:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dictionaries&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;with&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;'body'&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;containing&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;HTML&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;strings
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;[
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;{
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;'body':&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;"&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;HTML&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;"
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;},
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;:return:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tuples&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;containing&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;anchor&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;]

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;for&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;doc.xpath('//img'):

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;all_items&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;links&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;images
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;seen&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;set()
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;unique_items&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;[item&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;for&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;all_items&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;if&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;item[1]&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;not&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;seen&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;not&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;seen.add(item[1])]
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;return&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;unique_items
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular expression being utilized, is to strip out HTML entities. This was needed due to weird parsing issues with non-ASCII characters. Fortunately, I wasn't the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13939198/189134"&gt;first to encounter oddities like this&lt;/a&gt;. The list comprehension at the end of the function is returning only unique tuples of anchor text/link. I was surprised how often I'd end up with tuples such as &lt;code&gt;('this', 'http://google.com')&lt;/code&gt; in the same post. This uniqueness saved a lot of processing time later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all links in a post had been extracted, this information and information about the post itself, was saved to the database. If a post had no links, it was not saved. The database consisted of three tables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links - This table contains the base URLs seen in all posts. URLs are distinct. It also contains an ID that will be utilized for linking to the other tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post Links - This table contains information about links in a post. This includes the specific anchor text/link combinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link Results - This table contains the results of link status checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing the posts was fairly time consuming, but was able to be parallelized easily. That significantly cut down on processing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="checking-the-links"&gt;Checking the links&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#checking-the-links" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most time consuming portion of this entire project was actually checking link status. Each link that appeared in the &lt;code&gt;Links&lt;/code&gt; table was checked. As I mentioned in my first post, the original idea was to simply send a &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request to each URL. The idea was to save myself and the end point a tiny amount of bandwidth. I had over a million links to process. I figured a little saved bandwidth wouldn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turns out this isn't a good idea. When I started seeing larger sites as not being accessible, I go suspicious that something was wrong. These sites were returning status 405 errors. This indicates that the method is not allowed. So, I switched to &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; for every link. The next problem I ran into was that many sites didn't like the default user agent of the spider. They rejected requests with 404 and 401 errors. In the end, I got around this by mimicking Firefox on every request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those kinks worked out, every link was sent a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request that looked to be from a Firefox browser. The process would allow 20 seconds per link. If the link didn't respond in that time limit, it was declared inaccessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, I repeated the process with anything that hadn't returned a status code less than 400. Once more, on the third week, I repeated this with the failed links. At the end of three weeks, I had a list of sites that were inaccessible to me - on a residential connection - three times over a period of three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"&gt;SVG image&lt;/a&gt; that I created for the write up was generated with Pygal. The tables were the result of various break downs of the data via queries to the status results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up"&gt;Wrap up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#wrap-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rather proud of how the results turned out for this project. I went into it expecting about 15% of links to be broken, but I didn't really realize what the meant. Fifteen percent of 21 million total posts is over 3 million. That's a large number. BUT, it also ignored that a large percentage of posts don't contain links. I failed to consider that in my original hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than half of my sample had links (2.3M out of 5.6M). Of the 2.3M with links, only 1.5M were unique links. The final result of 10% failed links makes much more sense in this context. Ten percent of 1.5M links means that there are 150K links that are bad. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>A proposal to fix broken links on Stack Overflow</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-08-07T07:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-07T07:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-07:/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My proposal to decrease the number of broken links on Stack Overflow&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This post was &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on August 7th, 2015. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; about how many links on Stack Overflow are starting to rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-proposal"&gt;The proposal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-proposal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301002/189134"&gt;another hybrid&lt;/a&gt; of the previous &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224895/what-happened-to-the-broken-link-review-queue"&gt;broken link&lt;/a&gt; queue (as was mentioned &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them#comment229798_300916"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/300916/i-estimate-10-of-the-links-posted-here-are-dead-how-do-we-deal-with-them#comment229795_300916"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/300998/189134"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/300996/189134"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;) and an automated process to fix broken links with an archived version (which has also been &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301001/189134"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broken link queue should focus on editing and fixing the links in a post (as opposed to closing it). It'd be similar to the suggested edits queue, but with the focus intended to correct &lt;em&gt;links&lt;/em&gt; not spelling and grammar. This could be done by only allowing a user to edit the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility, I envision is presenting the user with the links in the post and a status on whether or not the link is available. If it's not available, give the user a way to change that specific link. Utilizing &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2054063/189134"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, I have a quick mock up of what I propose such a review task looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-queue"&gt;The Queue&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-queue" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenlinkqueue.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Broken Link Mock up" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/brokenlinkqueue.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the links that appear in the post are on the right hand side of the screen. The links that are accessible have a green check mark. The ones that are broken (and the reason for being in this queue) have a red X. When a user elects to fix a post, they are presented with a modal showing only the broken URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-automation"&gt;The Automation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-automation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this queue, though, I think an automated process would be helpful as well. The idea is that this would operate similarly to the Low Quality queue, where the system can automatically add a post to the queue if certain criteria are met &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a user can flag a post as having broken links. I've based my idea on what Tim Post outlined in the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130398/does-stack-exchange-crawl-websites/198357#comment741544_198357"&gt;comments to a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated process performs a "Today in History" type check. This keeps the fixes limited to a small subset of posts per day. It also focuses on older posts, which were more likely to have a broken link than something posted recently. Example: On July 31, 2015, the only posts being checked for bad links would be anything posted on July 31 in any year 2008 through current year - 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing the &lt;a href="http://archive.org/about/wayback_api.php"&gt;Wayback Machine API&lt;/a&gt;, or similar service, the system attempts to change broken links into an archived version of the URL. This archived version should probably be from "close" to the time the post was originally made. If the automated process isn't able to find an archived version of the link, the post should be tossed into the Broken Link queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Community edits a post to fix a link, a new Post History event is utilized to show that a link was changed. This would allow anyone looking at revision history to easily see that a specific change was only to fix links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions performed in the previous bullets are exposed to 10K users in the moderator tools. Much like recent close/delete posts show up, these do as well. This allows higher rep users to spot check (if they so desire). I think this portion is important when the automated process fixes a link. For community edits in the queue, the history tab in &lt;code&gt;/review&lt;/code&gt; seems sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a post consists of a large percentage of a link (or links) and these links were changed by Community, the post should have further action taken on it in some queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:
     - A post where X+% of the text is hyperlinks is very dependent on the links being active. If one or more of the links are broken, the post may no longer be relevant (or may be a link only post). One example I found while doing this was &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/4906230/revisions"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this type of edit from the Community user should bump a post to the front page. Edits done in the broken link queue, though, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; bump the post just like a suggested edit does today. By preventing the automated Community posts from being bumped, we prevent the the front page from being flooded, daily, with old posts and these edits. I think that the exposure in the 10K tools and the broken link queue will provide the visibility needed to check the process is working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="potential-pitfalls"&gt;Potential pitfalls&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#potential-pitfalls" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated link checking will likely run into several of the problems I did. Mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites modify the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request to send a 404 instead of a 405. My solution to this was to issue &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests for everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites don't like certain user agents. My solution to this was to mimic the Firefox user agent. To be a good internet citizen, Stack Exchange probably shouldn't go that far, but providing a unique user agent that is easily identifiable as "StackExchangeBot" (think "GoogleBot"), should be helpful in identifying where traffic is coming from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites that are down one week and up another. I solved this by spreading my tests over a period of 3 weeks. With the queue and automatic linking to an archived version of the site, this may not be necessary. However, immediately converting a link to an archived copy should be discussed by the community. Do we convert the broken link immediately? Or do we try again in X days. If it's still down then convert it? It was suggested in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/301002/189134"&gt;another answer&lt;/a&gt; that we first offer the poster the chance to make changes before an automatic process takes place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to throttle requests so that you don't flood a site with requests. I solved this by only querying unique URLs. This still issues a lot of requests to certain, popular, domains. This could be solved by staggering the checks over a period of minutes/hours versus spewing 100s - 1000s of &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests at midnight daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the broken link queue, I feel the first two would be acceptable. Much like posts in the Low Quality queue appear because of a heuristic, despite not being low quality, links will be the same way. The system will flag them as broken and the queue will determine if that is true (if an archived version of the site can't be found by the automated process). The bullet about throttling requests is an implementation detail that I'm sure the developers would be able to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>Analysis of links posted to Stack Overflow</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-08-06T07:35:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-08-06:/analysis-of-links-posted-to-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10% of on Stack Overflow are unavailable.

&lt;p&gt;This post was &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on August 6th, 2015. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300916/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Approximately 10% of 1.5M randomly selected unique links in the March 2015 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange"&gt;data dump&lt;/a&gt; are unavailable. To be more precise, that is approximately 150K dead links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running into more and more links that are dead on Stack Overflow and it's bothering me. In some cases, I've spent the time hunting down a replacement, in others I've notified the owner of the post that a link is dead, and (more shamefully), in others I've simply ignored it and left just a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/262040/189134"&gt;down vote&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously that's not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making sweeping generalizations that there are dead links everywhere, though, I wanted to make sure I wasn't just finding bad posts because I was wandering through the review queues. Utilizing the March 2015 data dump, I randomly selected about 25% of the posts (both questions and answers) and then parsed out the links. This works out to 5.6M posts out of 21.7M total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these 5.6M posts, 2.3M contained links and 1.5M of these were unique links. I sent each unique URL a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods"&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; request, with a user agent mimicking Firefox&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. I then retested everything that didn't return a successful response a week later. Finally, anything that failed from &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; batch, I resent a final test a week later. If a site was down in all three tests, I considered it down for this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results2"&gt;Results&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results2" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-status-code"&gt;By status code&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-status-code" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news/Bad News: A majority of the links returned a valid response, but there are still roughly 10% that failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="PIE CHART IMAGE" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/status_codes.svg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(This image is showing the top status codes returned)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three largest slices of the pie are the status 200s (site working!), status 404 (page not found, but server responded saying the page isn't found) and Connection Errors. Connection errors are sites that had no proper server response. The request to access the page timed out. I was generous in the time out and allowed a request to live for 20 seconds before failing a link with this status. The &lt;code&gt;4xx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5xx&lt;/code&gt; errors are status codes that fall in the 400 and 500 range of HTTP responses. These are client and server error ranges, thus counted as a failure. &lt;code&gt;2xx&lt;/code&gt; errors (of which was are in the low triple) are pages that responded with a success message in the 200 range, but it wasn't a &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; code. Finally, there were just over a hundred sites that hit a redirect loop that didn't seem to end. These are the &lt;code&gt;3xx&lt;/code&gt; errors. I failed a site with this range if it redirected more than 30 times. There are a negligible number of sites that returned status codes in the 600 and &lt;a href="https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc"&gt;700&lt;/a&gt; range&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-most-common"&gt;By most common&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#by-most-common" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, expectedly, many URLs that failed that appeared frequently in the sample set. Below is a list of the top 50&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; URLs that are in posts most often, but failed three times over the course of three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do with all of this? How do we, as a community, solve the issue of 10% of our outbound links pointing to places on the internet that no longer exist? Assuming that my sample was indicative of the entire data dump, there are close to 600K (150K broken unique links x 4, because I took 1/4 of the data dump as a sample) broken links posted in questions and answers on Stack Overflow. I assume a large number of links posted in comments would be broken as well, but that's an activity for another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage posters to provide snippets from their links just in case a link dies. That definitely helps, but the resources behind the links and the (presumably) expanded explanation behind the links are still gone. How can we properly deal with this? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like there have been a few previous discussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/198357/186281"&gt;Utilize the Wayback API to automatically fix broken links.&lt;/a&gt; Development appeared to stall on this due to the large number of edits the Community user would be making. This would also hide posts that depended on said link from being surfaced for the community to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224895/what-happened-to-the-broken-link-review-queue"&gt;Link review queue&lt;/a&gt;. It was in &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212023/where-can-i-access-the-link-validation-review-queue"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;, but disappeared in early 2014. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#footnotes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how it ultimately played out. Originally I sent &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; requests, in an effort to save bandwidth. This turned out to waste a whole bunch of time because there are a whole bunch of sites around the internet that return a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error"&gt;&lt;code&gt;405 Method Not Allowed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when sending a &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request. The next step was to sent &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests, but utilize the default Python &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; user-agent. A lot of sites were returning &lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; responses to this user agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to Stack Exchange sites were not counted in the above results. The failures seen are almost 100% due to a question/answer/comment being deleted. The process ran as an anonymous user, thus didn't have any reputation and was served a 404. A user with appropriate permissions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still visit the link. I verified a number of 404'd links to Stack Overflow posts and this was the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4th most common failure was to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. The 16th and 17th most common were &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; on ports other than 80. I removed these from the result table with the knowledge that these shouldn't be accessible from the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There where 7 total URLs that returned status codes in the &lt;code&gt;600&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc"&gt;&lt;code&gt;700&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; range. One such site was &lt;a href="http://learn.code.org/hoc/1"&gt;code.org&lt;/a&gt; with a status code of 752. Sadly, this is not even defined the joke RFC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/a-proposal-to-fix-broken-links-on-stack-overflow.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a proposal on how I think this could be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>How I set up this site with GitHub Pages and CloudFlare</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-07-09T11:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-07-09T11:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-07-09:/how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post provides a brief description of how I set up the web site to utilize GitHub Pages and CloudFlare and eliminated my self hosting&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I described why I moved from Wordpress to Pelican for my blog. This one goes a step further and describes how I eliminated the
need for the dedicated server I'd been utilizing as a part of &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;Team Vipers&lt;/a&gt;. By eliminating that server, I reduced my costs to zero but kept control
over the DNS of my domain (thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;) and had an easier method of updating the site using &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-pages-setup"&gt;GitHub Pages Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#github-pages-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize GitHub Pages, I needed to create a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that followed the format &lt;code&gt;GitHubUsername.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. This repository would house the
content that is this site. I also set up a second &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; which contains the source for the blog. This repository includes the templates, plugins
and markdown version of the pages. The first repository was set up as submodule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io.git output
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignored the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; on the source repository. Finally, I had to adjust &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; slightly to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this, I was constantly destroying the output repository and had to reinitialize it. This prevents that from occuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a new post consists of writing up the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-content/master/2015_07_09_how-i-set-up-this-site-with-github-pages-and-cloudflare.md"&gt;Markdown page&lt;/a&gt;, generating the page with the command below (or the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/82625417e3a14db3cbeafcaa68728fd5fe9834b2/generate_content_production.bat"&gt;batch script&lt;/a&gt;) and then committing and
pushing the changes to the submodule to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Generates HTML files without debugging information
pelican content --output output --settings publishconf.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new content is available immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="custom-domain"&gt;Custom Domain&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#custom-domain" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the URL for this site isn't &lt;code&gt;awegnergithub.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, but instead &lt;code&gt;andrewwegner.com&lt;/code&gt;. To accomplish this, I added a directory to the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;
named &lt;code&gt;extra&lt;/code&gt;. In this directory is a single file named &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/82625417e3a14db3cbeafcaa68728fd5fe9834b2/content/extra/CNAME"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (no extension). In the file is my domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I had to modify &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/awegnergithub.github.io-source/blob/master/pelicanconf.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to add the &lt;code&gt;extra/CNAME&lt;/code&gt; to the static path and then on generation move the &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; file from this subdirectory to the root.
I could have put it in the root of &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; by default, but Pelican provides a way to do this and it keeps &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; clean. &lt;strong&gt;One very important note&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;EXTRA_PATH_METADATA&lt;/code&gt; is
operating system sensitive. Since I am generating the content on a Windows machine, I had to use a backslash instead of the forward slash the documentation shows. I found this
after posing a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30512242/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow on why it wasn't working as the documentation suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two important fields to add or edit are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'extra/CNAME']
...
EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {'extra\CNAME': {'path': 'CNAME'},}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cloudflare-setup"&gt;Cloudflare Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#cloudflare-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thing I needed in order to get rid of my server was control over DNS. I could revert back to GoDaddy, but after a little research found that CloudFlare's additional CDN and
security was a "good thing" (because, you know, I'm such a highly traffic'd blog these days). Step one was signing up to CloudFlare. This was a 3-5 minute thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once signed up and signed in, I went to set up DNS. This was as simple as adding my domain name and waiting for CloudFlare to import my existing DNS records. With this, I kept by Google Apps
email intact (which is what I was most concerned with). Next, I went and removed the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; records. I replaced these with &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; records pointing to my GitHub Pages URL. I also added a &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; CNAME
pointing to the same location. Since I have Pelican configured to strip it with the setting below, it doesn't matter other than people expect to enter &lt;code&gt;www dot domain dot com&lt;/code&gt; in their URL bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;SITEURL = 'http://andrewwegner.com'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, I had to point by name servers to CloudFlare instead of my dedicated server. They provide a list of registrars to choose from. Select your registrar and follow the instructions. My biggest
issue here was remembering my GoDaddy password. After I made it into my account, the steps to change name servers were very simple. Once those are saved, you wait for the changes to propagate and
enjoy your new GitHub Pages / CloudFlare web page for free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Meta"/><category term="technical"/><category term="Pelican"/></entry><entry><title>Why I moved from Wordpress to Pelican</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-05-03T22:41:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T22:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-05-03:/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief summary of why I dropped Wordpress and moved to Pelican&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I maintained a Wordpress blog covering various things I've done or created. Most of these revolved around
things I created to make administering Team Vipers easier for me and for the rest of the admin team. It was my way
of documenting what I'd done (in case I ever needed to do it again) and providing a way to update the Team Vipers community
about new plugins or applications that would be deployed to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-issues-with-wordpress"&gt;My Issues with Wordpress&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-issues-with-wordpress" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I had with Wordpress was that it was just to bulky for the simple posts I was making. I needed a database, a full web
server (or a hosting provider), and either time to hunt for the "perfect" plugin(s) or PHP knowledge to do it myself. Early in my
development career, I used PHP a lot. That was part of the reason I chose Wordpress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! I know that language. If I ever need something, I can just whip it up myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Me, before the real world ambushed me and beat me with a stick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="spam"&gt;Spam&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent time setting up Wordpress. I picked out a theme, plugins, and started saving future me with documentation. Then life happened. For whatever
reason, I stopped updating Wordpress. My blog sat out there for weeks or months unvisited by anyone. Then, one morning, my phone vibrated
and told me that I had a new comment on my site. Woo! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was spam. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I marked it spam and moved on with my day. Later that morning, I glanced at my phone again. 32 emails. I am just not that popular. Something
was wrong. Turns out, a spam bot found me. I sighed and then removed all the comments and checked the box indicating that users had to
be registered to post. That solved my problem for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the bots got smarter. They started registering. They started posting legitimate looking messages, except for that associated URL their name
would link to in the comments. They pulled keywords out of the post and formulated a somewhat passable English question using those words. The spam
prevention plugins I installed would slow the tide for a few weeks. The bots would adapt and then I'd be awash with spam posts again. Eventually,
the solution was to completely disable comments. I'd spent way to much time dealing with spam on a blog that received very little legitimate traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't utilize the comments, Pelican provides a nice simple page that I can post my thoughts and not worry about getting hit by a spam bot. It also
provides plugins so that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include comments should I ever choose to do so in the future. For the time being, though, I have a nice simple page 
with no comments. That's exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="security"&gt;Security&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch any technology web sites, you'll notice that there are vulnerabilities found in Wordpress frequently. These require patches,
which requires me to do something. It may be as simple as logging in and clicking a button to update, but it is still something I need to 
remember to do for a relatively minor site. When I'd log in to clear the spam backlog, I'd frequently also install updates for 10-20 plugins, themes or
Wordpress itself. It was mostly painless, but I didn't like the idea of the site sitting there vulnerable for weeks at a time because I didn't
visit and login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of Wordpress and the underlying database exposed a fairly sizable target for a web page so small. Pelican generates static
HTML pages. I don't have to worry about SQL injections, unauthorized logins, or anything else. I host a basic set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 
That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="php-vs-python"&gt;PHP vs Python&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#php-vs-python" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I used to use PHP frequently. It was my go to language. I picked Wordpress with the idea that I'd be able to hack together features I needed.
The reality, it turns out, was that I wasn't actually interested in doing that. Instead, I picked out plugins that were close enough to the
exact functionality I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I transferred to a job where I used Python. Instead of having a language I used on the side (PHP) and a job where I was a glorified project manager, without the 
actual title of "Project Manager", I now had a job where I used a language (Python) for 8 hours a day. My usage of PHP plummeted. I found I could get what I wanted
done in my side projects faster and easier with Python. At work I used Python to build tools for engineering problems. At home, I started using it for every day
tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I realized I hadn't used PHP for several versions of the language. My knowledge of the language was outdated. The biggest reason I'd chosen Wordpress was no longer
relevant, because I couldn't write anything complicated in PHP without glancing at documentation to do even simple things. It's sad that I lost the intimate knowledge of
a language, but I feel that I've been more productive with Python anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is written in Python. Even more importantly though, it generates HTML files which are hosted. I don't need to run a Python environment on a server. I just
need to host HTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#markdown" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've fought with Wordpress's text editor countless times. This happened most often when attempting to add code blocks. It was a pain to do. It was a pain
to fix when the blocks broke. Pelican supports Markdown. Markdown is supported by large organizations like GitHub, reddit and Stack Exchange. I use all three of those.
I know how to utilize Markdown to create code blocks, headers, insert images, create bulleted lists. All without needing to fight how the text editor is going to actually
save the data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Meta"/><category term="Pelican"/></entry><entry><title>I'm running to be a moderator of Stack Overflow</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-04-06T22:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-04-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-04-06:/i'm-running-to-be-a-moderator-of-stack-overflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm running for a Stack Overflow moderator position in April 2015.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#"&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; has over 130 sites in its network. Each of those sites has at least 3 moderators that are glorified &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;janitors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the moderation work is extremely mundane, almost janitorial. Itâs deleting obvious spam, closing blatantly off-topic questions, and culling some of the worst rated posts in various dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal moderator does as little as possible. But those little actions may be powerful and highly concentrated. Judiciously limiting your use of moderator powers to selectively prune and guide the community â now thatâs the true art of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works so well in the Stack Exchange network because the users are able to handle most moderation tasks. As users gain reputation, they gain privileges. With these privileges, they are better able to maintain and cultivate the content on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all activity can be performed by users though. This is where moderators come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/users/78/andy?tab=profile"&gt;&lt;img alt="Andy on Community Building" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/community_building_andy_flair.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have a diamond (â¦) on the &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt; site. I was &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/138/78"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; one of the Pro Tempore moderators during the beta phase of the site. This is my first experience moderating on Stack Exchange, beyond what my reputation on Stack Overflow
gets me. &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/77/78"&gt;It is not, however, my first time moderating&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Community Building&lt;/em&gt; is focused on various aspects of building communities - both online and off. It caters to users from all aspects of a site (owners, moderators, users, advertisers and any thing else).
My experience here led me to pursuing a moderator position on Stack Overflow. This site is orders of magnitude larger than &lt;em&gt;Community Building&lt;/em&gt;. It has millions of users and millions of questions. With all this traffic, there are still only 18 diamond moderators. The
idea of community moderation shows that it scales well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nomination-phase"&gt;Nomination Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election cycle begins with the nomination phase. Users nominate themselves for the position. In 1200 characters or less, you lay out your platform. In this phase, nearly anyone can nominate themselves. However, there are only 30 positions available. If more than 30 people
nominate themselves, then the users with the lowest reputation get bumped. With only 11K reputation, I am at the lower end of the spectrum of other nominees, but I am well above the lowest. I have the 8th lowest reputation. I've looked at previous election cycles. It seems unlikely
that there will be 30 or more nominees. I think that I am safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-platform"&gt;My Platform&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-platform" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted my &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election/6#post-29480018"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the nomination phase opened. I stressed the work that I've already done on Stack Overflow and previous moderation experience on another Stack Exchange site (Community Building).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Andy and I want to be one of your moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why vote for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've built an automated script to handle &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/280546/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically"&gt;noisy comments&lt;/a&gt;. It runs daily, probably to the chagrin of the current moderators, but it helps keep the comments noise down and it is incredibly accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the automated flagging, I participate in the review queues, provide edits and post &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=answers"&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a moderator of &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;"Community Building"&lt;/a&gt;, I know the tools used by the Stack Exchange sites. I've used this position to interact with the existing moderators for advise and questions. This interaction will not only continue but be helpful as a new moderator to SO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the flagging history and experience to make the appropriate judgment calls. I feel that is a positive attribute that will help me in helping you to have the best experience you can on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll continue to help improve the site regardless of whether I am elected or not. I will be able to do a much better job at that, though, as one of your moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I received my "candidate score". It was 29/40. Not the highest, but not the lowest either. I expect, if any one is concerned about this score, it will be mentioned it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Candidate Score" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_candidate_score.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nomination-phase-comments"&gt;Nomination Phase Comments&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-phase-comments" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 11, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments on my nomination post have focused mostly on the pros and cons of the automated script I built to flag comments. I was expecting this discussion. I'd classify most of the comments about the script as
"cautious". Users seem concerned about something completely automated used to moderate or that I focus on low priority content. My response to this concern was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] by automating the removal of this lower priority content it is easier to focus on the actively harmful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to point out that I have done more than "build a script". I've actively participated in review queues on Stack Overflow for years. I've flagged appropriate content
(with a high percentage marked as accepted). I have also been moderator on Community Building. All of this, in combination with the automation, makes up my "platform".
I have the experience of moderation, the knowledge of how the system works and the drive to improve the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also mentioned a few times that I'd be unlikely to utilize such an automated tool as a moderator. I promised to bring this concern up when I moved further into the election process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I received a few comments supporting either me or the work that I've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automation is very impressive - thanks for that, it's a real contribution to the quality of the site. That said - as a privileged user I suspect you won't be able to run these sort of scripts on your account for obvious reasons.  â  Benjamin Gruenbaum Apr 6 at 21:34&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can vouch for Andy's track record as a pro tem mod on Community Building. I want to note as well for the record that many of the main site questions and answers on Community Building are explicitly about moderation, and his contributions there also provide insight into his approach to the job. â  Air Apr 7 at 16:54&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh. I have to say I'm impressed. Putting you on my list of candidates to watch. â  Qix Apr 7 at 19:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to point out that your response to my concerns is fair and reasonable, as well as polite, even if it isn't quite exactly how I see things. It certainly alleviates my concerns of misusing moderator power. I will be seriously considering voting for you. â  jpmc26 Apr 8 at 6:41&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm pleased with how the discussion has gone. It has been a few days since there were comments left though. Hopefully a little interest picks up during the primary phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very impressed by the other candidates. There are many very good candidates that I'd be happy to work with (or be unashamed to lose to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primary-phase"&gt;Primary Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#primary-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 17, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nomination phases has ended. I have advanced to the primary phase. The purpose of this phase is to narrow the list of 30 candidates to 10. Those 10 will be the ones that can be voted on to be the next moderators. In the primary phase, users can vote nominees up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the election process, one of the other &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/616460/jason-c"&gt;candidates&lt;/a&gt; created several tools to help users see nominee activity. He also created a &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290346/2015-election-live-vote-monitor"&gt;live vote monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It was exciting to hang out in the Election Chat room and watch votes roll in. The position of 10th was highly contested
toward the end of the primary. I was very pleased to see that everyone remained civil in the chat room too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended this phase with &lt;strong&gt;1492&lt;/strong&gt; positive votes. This put me in 15th. Sadly, not enough to advance to the election phase. However, there are several excellent candidates that did advance. Good luck to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Live Vote Counter at the end of the Primary" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_primary_live_vote.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-primary-data"&gt;Other Primary Data&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#other-primary-data" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the primary phase involves answering questions that users have posed during the nomination phase. These questions were voted upon and the highest were included in the questionnaire. My &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290096/2015-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire/290122#290122"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; was removed at the end of this phase because I did not advance. I was
prepared with answers about my moderation style and my expectations for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other tools that was created during this cycle showed &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289995/2015-moderator-candidate-activity-profiles"&gt;nominee activity&lt;/a&gt; on the site over time. This was a quick way to compare nominees based on the number of activities they have performed on undeleted posts (because data related to deleted posts is removed from public view). It
provided, at a glance, a way to see who is and is not active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the charts of my activity that the tool created. The green vertical bar is account creation date. The orange/brown vertical bars are previous election windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stack Overflow Activity Chart" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_so_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
This is my activity chart for Stack Overflow itself. It shows that I've had an account since 2009, but didn't really start utilizing the site, more than occassionally, until 2013. Since then, it shows that a large majority of my
activity onsite is in the review queues. There are posts, revisions, comments and more along the bottom, but most of my activity is in the review queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Stack Overflow Activity Chart" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_mso_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Meta Stack Exchange Activity Chart" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_mse_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
My Meta Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange charts show a fairly low activity level. Unfortunately, I think this is obscuring the posts that I do make simply because of the large scale on the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Combined Activity Chart" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/april_2015_combined_activity_chart.png"/&gt;
Finally, the last chart shows the combined activity across all three areas (SO, MSO, and MSE). It looks very similar to the Stack Overflow one because of the lower activity levels on the two Meta sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="election-phase"&gt;Election Phase&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#election-phase" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 21, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election is over. Three great candidates were elected. One thing I am like about Stack Exchange's elections is their &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/77560/186281"&gt;usage of OpenSTV and the Meek STV method&lt;/a&gt;. The results of each round of the
election cycle are available at &lt;a href="http://www.opavote.org/results/4962933813542912/0"&gt;opavote.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final-thoughts" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most elections, there are known and unknown winners before the election even begins. The response that &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"&gt;Martijn Pieters&lt;/a&gt; received from the time he nominated through the final moments of the election all but guarenteed a victory for him. It is a
well deserved victory. I hope that he is able to keep up his frequent, high quality, answers in the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python"&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; tag. If not, his drop in activity will be felt. The surprise, to me, was &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1114/jeremy-banks"&gt;Jeremy Banks&lt;/a&gt;. He ended in 9th place in the primaries. That doesn't mean he can't do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've interacted with all three moderators on site and in chat prior to their victory. I've been very happy with those interactions. With their promotion, I look forward to working with them as a moderator on the Stack Exchange network in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the winners!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Zephyr - The bot that watches for low quality vote requests</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-03-12T23:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-03-12:/zephyr-the-bot-that-watches-for-low-quality-vote-requests.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Find out about the bot that watches Stack Exchange chat rooms for requests to close low quality content&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange receives thousands of questions per day across all of their sites. Not all of these are high quality
posts. Fortunately, users of the Stack Exchange network are given &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; to help keep that low quality stuff to a 
minimum. One of these tools is the chat network that spans the Stack Exchange sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chat rooms, a convention has arisen to tag a message as &lt;kbd class="light"&gt;cv-pls&lt;/kbd&gt; for questions that need to be closed for one reason 
or another. Over time, this evolved to include other tags such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;del-pls&lt;/kbd&gt; for a deletion request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;spam&lt;/kbd&gt; for notification that spam made it through the already &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/228043/"&gt;impressive&lt;/a&gt; spam &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/237882/186281"&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd class="light"&gt;reopen&lt;/kbd&gt; for a reopen request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few others to cover specific flag types (eg. Not an answer, Very Low Quality or Offensive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introducing-zephyr"&gt;Introducing Zephyr&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-zephyr" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these is that the requests are only seen by users active in the specific room where it was posted. 
Other users across the network miss the request. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/SE_Zephyr_VoteRequest_bot"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was built to resolve this problem. Zephyr monitors
several rooms where these types of requests are frequent. These requests all all posted into a single &lt;a href="http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/773/low-quality-posts-hq"&gt;chat room&lt;/a&gt;. 
This provides users with a single room to monitor to see requests for multiple questions and sites across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of what Zephyr's chat activity looks like during a spam wave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zephyr's chat activity during a spam wave" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/zephyr-spam-wave.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr utilizes the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange"&gt;ChatExchange&lt;/a&gt; package to join and read the chat rooms. To do this, Zephyr required a dedicated
account. I decided to run Zephyr with a dedicated account to completely separate the bot that would sit and watch multiple chat
rooms 24/7 from my account. Zephyr maintains a small SQLite database of all the posts that it records. The idea behind this, 
is that eventually this data will be utilized to train other systems on unwanted content. This information is pulled via
the &lt;a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr watches the chat rooms for specific string &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/SE_Zephyr_VoteRequest_bot/blob/master/create_config_files.py"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;. If these patterns are matched, a message is posted if &lt;code&gt;should_post&lt;/code&gt; 
is &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; for the matched pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a nice simple application. It performs some pattern matching and a couple API calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-bots"&gt;Other bots&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#other-bots" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to watching user activity, Zephyr also watches two other quality bots that patrol Stack Exchange for low
quality content: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector"&gt;SmokeDetector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ArcticEcho/Phamhilator/wiki"&gt;Phamhilator&lt;/a&gt;. If either of these bots detect spam, Zephyr takes note of the information by
recording it to the database, but not reposting. Since both of those bots post their reports, it didn't make sense for Zephyr
to add a second (or third, if both of the others detected spam) message to the chat room. The information is recorded, though,
to help future training for other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="updates"&gt;Updates&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updates" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 8, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time Zephyr has been updated to include new rooms to monitor or new patterns to match. Those changes are small (and simple).
There are, however, a few larger changes that I'd like to note below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="commands"&gt;Commands&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#commands" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other bots that Zephyr monitors respond to user input. Zephyr has very little that requires user interaction since all of it's
posts are generated &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; user input. However, there have been times where I, as the bot owner, would like to be able to issue
certain commands to it. My most common desire is to see a report of how many spam posts Zephyr has seen. Thus, Zephyr now responds
to the command &lt;code&gt;spamreport&lt;/code&gt; from me. It then prints out a nice summary of information. This information has been utilized in 
SmokeDetector to watch for commonly spammed domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zephyr spam report for April 2015" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/zephyr-spam-report.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upgrade-from-sqlite-to-mariadb"&gt;Upgrade from SQLite to MariaDB&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#upgrade-from-sqlite-to-mariadb" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr was originally built against an SQLite database. This worked, but was getting slower as more data was being added. This slow down
was beginning to affect performance. I started seeing this error more and more frequently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a lot of time troubleshooting and not resolving it to my satisfaction, I decided to upgrade to a more robust database. I'd used
MySQL/MariaDB before and I happened to have another application utilizing MariaDB at the moment so that is the solution I picked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was transferring data. I learned that there isn't a decent utility to do a straight migration. So, I took these steps to transfer the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export table structures and data from SQLite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the SQLite dump to MySQL format. Though both systems use SQL, there are slight differences in dialect. I utilized
 &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1067365/189134"&gt;this Python script&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point. It got me most of the way there, but not completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data clean up. Ugh. The dreaded part of the job for anyone who handles data. Fortunately, the script above did most of the work.
 I ended up fixing a couple stray back ticks that didn't convert properly, escaping a very extra quotation marks, and replacing
 a few "smart quotes" (of both the &lt;a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/201c/index.htm"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/201d/index.htm"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; variety). I wish data at the office job was this easy to clean...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import into MariaDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the transfer to MariaDB, I've noticed no performance degradation. The error about threads has been eliminated as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upgrade-to-utilize-web-sockets"&gt;Upgrade to utilize web sockets&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#upgrade-to-utilize-web-sockets" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Zephyr used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/blob/master/chatexchange/rooms.py#L68"&gt;&lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method when monitoring a room. This method would long poll the room. It turns out that this is 
pretty unreliable. I'd get multiple errors through out the week, ranging from &lt;code&gt;Connection Aborted&lt;/code&gt; errors to random &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; messages. The 
solution has been to switch to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/blob/master/chatexchange/rooms.py#L78"&gt;&lt;code&gt;watch_socket&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The only time I've had problems since this switch is when the Stack Exchange 
web sockets go down. This saves a lot of restarts to get everything up and running again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Programming Projects"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="automation"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>Thanks for all the fish</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-01-08T15:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-04-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-01-08:/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good bye, Team Vipers, it's been a great 6 years&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="goodbye-team-vipers"&gt;Goodbye Team Vipers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#goodbye-team-vipers" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Team Vipers shut down. Exactly 6 years after I join the community and 5 years after taking
over as owner, I decided to step aside. I announced my decision to my admin team in November and asked if anyone wanted to
take over. A week later I made the announcement public. I copied that below. My hope was that someone would be willing to
take over day to day operations and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one was able to take on the responsibilities. I had to make the hard choice of shutting down the community.
I am unable to provide the time or monetary commitment this community requires any longer. Team Vipers was a home and
community for 6 years. I've met a lot of people playing games with members of the community. Several other sites were
created by members of Team Vipers. They have indicated they'd be willing to absorb and welcome members from Vipers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a great run. So long Vipers, and thanks for all the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Thanks for the fish" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/thanks-for-the-fish.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="original-announcement"&gt;Original Announcement&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#original-announcement" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 5th, 2015, I am stepping away from Vipers as the owner and administrator. Unfortunately, I no longer have time
to maintain the servers in a way that benefits the community. I announced this to the admin team earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-do-we-do-before-january-5th"&gt;What do we do before January 5th?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-we-do-before-january-5th" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am giving you this heads up to discuss the future of Vipers. If someone wants to step up and take everything on, I'll
gladly offer help during the transition. If you have questions about what happens behind the scenes, I'll answer those
as well. In fact, I'll start with a few questions that I think may help lead this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-multiple-game-servers"&gt;Do we need multiple game servers?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#do-we-need-multiple-game-servers" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer - No. If the community wants to focus on a specific server mode, then a single server is all that is needed.
When I joined Vipers there were two servers: An Orange server and a vanilla server. For the first year-ish, the
servers base grew and contracted around different mods. Orange turned to Crit Orange, a Randomizer appeared and then
splintered into it's own community, the Nest grew and then shrank. Zombie popped up. Prophunt and Dodgeball came around
multiple times. In all of this, there has been between one or two popular servers, with the rest being very niche. Those
are for fun. Those are also frustrating to fix when updates break them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-a-dedicated-server"&gt;Do we need a dedicated server?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#do-we-need-a-dedicated-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, no. The benefit the dedicated server provided is IP address stability. Before the dedicated server, the game servers
jumped around IPs every few months. With each move players were lost. Some found us months or years later when they
randomly stumbled upon us. Others are just gone. More importantly though, is dealing with performance. If there is a
hosting company that can provide high quality, low ping, servers at a cheap price - that is worth it. A word of advice,
avoid EscapedTurkey. It is a one man operation and that person doesn't know what they are doing. If an issue crops up,
it takes hours to days to resolve it. It is because of them that we purchased a dedicated server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note. I can not transfer the dedicated server to anyone. It's rented in my name and the hosting company doesn't
allow transfers. So, no matter what happens, the IP addresses would have to change anyway. The upside of this long
transition period is that you have plenty of time to advertise and set up the new servers. We could have in game announcements
AND we can lock the existing servers with the new IP in the titles. It won't be an immediate cut over. It provides
notification to the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-the-forums"&gt;Do we need the forums?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#do-we-need-the-forums" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The forums are what kept me in Vipers before I ended up in the position I'm in now. Without the forums, there is no
community. There are people that you see frequently on the servers, but rarely any meaningful interaction. With the forums
we get stories of our members' lives. If, however, you are going to stick to playing Valve games, I highly recommend a
change in forum software. Find something that supports integration with Steam (either natively or via plugin) and start
over. With that integration, you can do so many more (and non-hackish) things. You can pull information from Steam or
any other TF2 community that exposes an API. Banning a player on the servers and the forums is easy as both are based
on the same thing. Additionally, requiring the Steam login should eliminate the spam (no random Chinese, Russian,
Californian spam bots). In any case, I will provide a full database dump for you. If you stick with PHPBB, I think a
fresh install of PHPBB would be a good thing, but you'll have all of the data and should be able to simply import it
into the database. If you go with something else, you'll have the database and can attempt to use that software's
conversion script. Results will vary on how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="does-we-make-money-on-donations"&gt;Does we make money on donations?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#does-we-make-money-on-donations" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Since July of [2014 to November 2014], the community has donated $20. Total. It has been 14 months since we reached our monthly
goal. In the last year, we have broken $50 only 4 times. To prevent someone from misconstruing this as a plea for
money, I've disabled donations. I don't want someone to start a misguided "Save the Vipers" campaign that you believe
can succeed with donations. The way to "save the vipers" is to come together as a team and discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-happens-if-no-one-steps-up"&gt;What happens if no one steps up?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-if-no-one-steps-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone in the community may step up, but if no one steps up by January, then Vipers has one last New Years hoo-rah
and fades to the internet. If someone does step up, I am still available to help with initial set up. I'm still available
to play games and to talk to. I'm not dropping off the face of the earth and I'm not rage quitting. This is very
much a case of real life happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is going to cover your initial questions. If you have more, post them here and I'll answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has been a great 6 years with everyone here. While I may be stepping down as owner, if someone keeps Vipers around,
you'll keep me around as a regular. I've had fun talking to all of you and playing with (and against) all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="updated-steam-group-ownership"&gt;Updated Steam Group Ownership&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updated-steam-group-ownership" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated April 28, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership of the Steam Group for Team Vipers has been transferred back to Russell, the original founder of Vipers. The
&lt;a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viperservers#announcements/detail/205255298394906049"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; was posted to the group earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also transferred data from the Vipers blog to my personal one here and removed links to Vipers from most posts
since they will all fail to resolve correctly. Unfortunately, it's not worth it to preserve small bits of history in
this case and was just easier to remove the links. The best I can do it transfer the blog posts and copy snippets or
screenshots here. Direct links to the forum discussions has been intentionally removed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vipers"/><category term="team vipers"/></entry><entry><title>Can a machine be taught to flag comments automatically</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2015-01-02T08:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-01-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2015-01-02:/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-comments-automatically.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Description of how I automatically flag comments on Stack Overflow&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;This post was originally &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy?tab=profile"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow on December 14, 2014. I've republished it here
so that I can easily update information related to recent developments. If you have questions or comments, I highly
encourage you to visit the &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280546/189134"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow and post there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Yes it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 27, 2014 Skynet awoke. It looked at Stack Overflow and thought "Why are all these people being so chatty and talking about obsolete things? I should nuke them all!" Fortunately, Skynet was a baby and only had access to my 100 comment flags a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this activation date, the system was fed with 10,000 "Good Comments", "Obsolete" comments and "Too Chatty" comments. These comments were taken from the &lt;a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Stack Exchange Data Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. The "Obsolete" and "Too Chatty" comment types had to meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total comment length of less than 100 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment has a 0 score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had variations of the following phrases:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;'%mark%answer%'
'%mark%accept%'
'%accept%answer%'
'%lease%accept%'
'%mark%answer%'
'%thank%you%'
'%thx%you%'
'%.....'
'+1%'
'-1%'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good Comments" were assumed, initially, to be anything that didn't fall into the above criteria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provided a base of 30,000 comments that were roughly categorized into 3 distinct groups. Manually scanning the classifications took several weeks, and through this some of the groupings were changed to reflect a more appropriate classification. Not all comments less than 100 characters starting with "Thank you" are "too chatty", just as not all comments over 100 characters are good comments. I reclassified these comments as if I had encountered them on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step was to train a classifier. I had initially assumed that I'd start with a Naive Bayes to get a baseline and then work to something more complicated from there. Perhaps, extract text features, user information, etc. and build a fancy classifier. My initial tests showed that the Naive Bayes was accurate 80-90% of the time with test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I combined the classifier's certainty of classification with an acceptable threshold of when I'd allow a flag to be issued in my name. Tuning these threshold took a few weeks but eventually I determined the following thresholds were appropriate for my use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;Type            | Threshold     | Flagging Enabled&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
too chatty      | 0.9997        | True
obsolete        | 0.99          | True
good comment    | 0.9999        | False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a comment is classified, if it exceeds the threshold for one of the above, it is recorded into my database for future retraining. If flagging is enabled, the API is &lt;a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/comment-flag-options"&gt;utilized&lt;/a&gt; to issue an &lt;a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/create-comment-flag"&gt;appropriate&lt;/a&gt; flag. Obviously, I don't want to flag good comments, but I do want to record them so that I can reuse the data in a later training step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have the results of this experiment been? From my point of view, I'd venture that it's been successful. I have automatically flagged over 17,000 comments. As of December 17, 2014, the process has been running for 173 days. My comment flagging stats are currently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;26885&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flagged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;26714&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deemed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;helpful&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;171&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;declined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started at (approximately):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;9885&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flagged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;9847&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deemed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;helpful&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;declined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives me an overall accuracy of 99.36%. Down from 99.61% when no automated process was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are pictures that help tell this story too. In this first one, we see that the rolling 10 day average for the number of declined flags has stayed below two flags a day. In October, there was a two week period where the rolling average was 0 and nearly a month long period where the system did not make any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/flags_per_day_rolling_average.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, the number of mistakes has climbed slightly. The biggest number of mistakes it has made was the opening day of Winter Bash 2014. Purely speculation, but I believe this was the moderators being protective of content and not wanting people to farm the &lt;a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/resolution"&gt;Resolution hat&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I don't know this. Another theory I have about this uptick since November is the adjustment to day light saving time. My process starts 10 minutes after UTC. It is possible that this earlier hour has caused my flags to be processed by a different moderator, or a moderator that is more awake/less hungry/in a different mood than previously at this point in the daily rotation cycle or because they &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/215397/186281"&gt;lost their keys&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Total flagged vs Total Declined" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/total_flags_vs_total_declined.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for 3 days, since June 27th, the process has flagged 100 comments a day. In this chart, you can see the number of declined comment flags along the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Number of comments saved per day" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/comments_saved_per_day.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this chart shows the number of comments that the system wanted to act on (and a rolling 5 day average). When the system was brought online, it was acting on 700-800 comments a day (saving to my local database). Many of these were being classified as "Good Comments". You can see the day that I adjusted the threshold for "Good Comments" to be acted upon (saved). The drop in the number of comments the system saved is dramatic. Instead of saving 700-800 comments daily, the system now averages about 150 comments to save. Since I don't flag "Good Comments", I feel this is the appropriate action to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 id="flagged-but-declined"&gt;Flagged but declined&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#flagged-but-declined" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, I've had comments flags declined. Some of these obviously should have been and required a retraining or threshold adjustment on my part. Others, in my opinion, should have been removed as noise. Below is a small sampling of both types of comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent comments that I feel are noise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27420526/i-want-to-play-from-frame-2-and-then-stop-at-frame-3/27425983#comment43388489_27425983"&gt;yes thank you so much for you help it works sorry for the late reply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some comments that were incorrectly flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18545905/meteor-without-mongo#comment42850716_18545905"&gt;@Spina: yes. Check my answer. You can simply point MONGO_URL to an invalid URL.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27007685/how-can-i-position-divs-at-the-bottom-of-container-div-and-inline/27007772#comment42544238_27007772"&gt;Sorry, my error. I was: "position", not "display". Check it: jsfiddle.net/hvfku99c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26745185/multiple-spacebar-conditional-operators/26745790#comment42078870_26745790"&gt;I believe UI.registerHelper is, being deprecated. Please check my updated answer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other comments are flagged but then edited prior to a moderator seeing the comment. The edit adds information to the post, thus the declination is justified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27406267/neo4j-very-slowly-using-shortestpath#comment43271781_27406267"&gt;Yes, I have indexes. Let me show my schema&lt;/a&gt; was edited to the much more useful: &lt;code&gt;Yes, I have indexes for UUID and Permission. In fact rlationship is a variable length here (e)-[rp:Has_Pocket|Has_Document*0..]-&amp;gt;d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26535662/how-to-read-files-in-sequence-from-a-directory-in-opencv/26536198#comment41709286_26536198"&gt;Here is the question i had posted first using FIleStorage issue&lt;/a&gt; was edited to include the link to the referenced post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that despite getting flags declined, some comments do eventually disappear. This is due to either flags raised by other community members putting the comment back in front of a moderator or by simply accumulating enough community flags for the system to act automatically. In either case, the desired result of removing noise has been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27006363/node-js-parse-filename-from-url/27006555#comment42544432_27006555"&gt;Oh, derr. good point. Edited.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27073761/redefining-the-hitbox-of-objects/27073838#comment42659999_27073838"&gt;You're right! Hopefully you see my point anyways.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lessons-and-observations"&gt;Lessons and Observations&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#lessons-and-observations" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication to other sites would depend on site culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a (fairly) non-subjective site, Stack Overflow made a good test case for this. On a site like &lt;a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Community Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://parenting.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Parenting&lt;/a&gt; or other site that accepts subjective answers, "too chatty" would be much harder to classify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/277314/189134"&gt;+/-1 has been discouraged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation I made on my own that comments with this type of content were distracting has been noticed by others as well. This was actually a very nice validation of my own process and some of the results posted on that thread show many such comments continue to be noise. Of course, this change did also force users to modify their content and may have added new patterns that can be utilized in future training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/245416/186281"&gt;automatically check flags&lt;/a&gt; would be great so that automated runs could be paused if it goes crazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of checking that my flagging history remains accurate is time consuming. The status of a flag can't be acquired via the API. I've submitted a feature request for this information to be added to the API. With this information, flagging can be paused or stopped if X number of flags are declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Overflow's volume of comments is a crutch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the &lt;a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/200435#graph"&gt;high volume of comments&lt;/a&gt; and limited number of comment flags my account has available, I can afford to be picky on which comments I want to act on. The classifier itself is about 85% accurate in determining the type of comment. However, I artificially increase my accuracy by only acting on comments that have a very high classifier certainty by forcing this certainty level to meet or surpass my threshold values from above. Smaller sites, with a lower volume, don't have the benefit of having enough comments to be this picky. It is on these sites that a more feature based classifier would be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human element is still unpredictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classifier was trained utilizing my idea of how comments should be flagged. Prior to automating this, I was not 100% accurate. Additionally, moderators are not 100% accurate in their processing of flags. &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/278813/189134"&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280426/189134"&gt;disagree&lt;/a&gt; on how these rules should be implemented, but are willing to &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/278927/189134"&gt;assist&lt;/a&gt; in keeping the site clean. With more than 175K comments a week, every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discussion"&gt;Discussion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my title states, my original question was whether or not I can teach a machine how to flag comments as I would. The answer to that is yes. The next question is whether this type of system would be helpful in cleaning up comments across Stack Overflow. My system works only on new comments created around each new UTC. Once my 100 flags are hit (or the API tells me to stop), it shuts down for the day. Having something automated go through historical comments or that can run all day would be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, now that I've admitted that I've been automatically flagging comments, can I continue to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;Update&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#update" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section has been updated multiple times since the original post. Most recently, it was updated May 3, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the introduction, this was originally published in December 2014. How is the system behaving now? It is performing very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="process-changes"&gt;Process Changes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#process-changes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2015, &lt;a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/283030/189134"&gt;another user&lt;/a&gt; was using a basic query to look for invalid comments. This caused a high number of moderator flags, many of which were declined. My process was caught in this mass decline. This resulted in 49 declined flags for a single day.
This is, by far, the largest number of declined flags the process has generated in a day. It did, however, prompt a process change after consultation with the Stack Overflow moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process will no longer flag comments newer than 48 hours old. This provides users with a two day window to see a comment before the system will flag it. This single change has provided a huge improvement in terms of flag acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="may-2015-11-months"&gt;May 2015 (11 Months)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#may-2015-11-months" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly a year of running, these are my flagging statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;39938&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flagged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;39659&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deemed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;helpful&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;279&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;declined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a helpful rate of 99.3%. This is down &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; slightly from 99.36% in December. I attribute a large part of the dip to the issue mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/latest_flags_per_day_rolling_average.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an updated chart showing the rolling 10 day average for number of declined flags. I've had several stretches of multi-week time frames with no declined flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a busy chart, so I've narrowed it down to show just the last 90 days. From here you can see that in the past 90 days there have been only 10 declined flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average - 90 day window" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/latest_flags_per_day_rolling_average_90day_window.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sept-2015-15-months"&gt;Sept 2015 (15 Months)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#sept-2015-15-months" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been almost 15 months since the process started. In that time, the model has gotten more accurate. Since the last update in May, I've had only 3 declined comment flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;52351&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flagged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;52069&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deemed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;helpful&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;282&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;declined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a helpful rate of 99.46%. Here is an updated chart showing the rolling 10 day average for number of declined flags. The 90 day window is not even worth showing. It has three days where a single flag was declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flags per day with rolling 10 day average - 15 Months of data training" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/declined_per_day_15_months.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary-of-2015"&gt;Summary of 2015&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-2015" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I processed comments 359 days out of the year. I missed three in January due to stopping it after a mass decline of flags (more later), I can't account for a missed day in July and August. I don't recall stopping it, but I missed July 3rd and August 19. I also missed December 28th due to a power issue. I flagged 35,960 comments. Of that, 111 were declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By month, this is the break down of rejected flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2015 Flag Summary" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/2015-flag-summary.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blip at the end of November is due to new moderators being elected and adjusting to what other moderators consider "good" versus "bad" comments. I didn't see the spike in the April election which is interesting, but after a couple days in November it's back to normal. The January spike I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting note: The longest stretch in the year with no declined flags was from August 13th through November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Programming Projects"/><category term="Stack Exchange"/><category term="machine learning"/><category term="automation"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>Moderation postion on Moderators</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/moderation-postion-on-moderators.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2014-07-02T10:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2014-07-02:/moderation-postion-on-moderators.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've thrown my hat into the ring for a moderation position on Stack Exchange's newest site: Moderators&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been the owner of Vipers for almost 5 years. In that time I've help the community grown and get stronger. I've helped
members begin their own communities and I've maintained the game servers the players utilize 24 hours a day. I've been 
concerned about low activity, excited about new events and updates, and watched the community ebb and flow through out
the years. I've dealt with trolls, spammers, and new community members. I think I've gained valuable experience in 
managing a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also a member on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189134/andy"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and over the years gotten to know others that enjoy the "Meta" aspect of 
Stack Exchange. That's the "behind the scenes", "how does this site work?" discussions and activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moderators"&gt;Moderators&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#moderators" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I found a way to merge my experience with Vipers and the knowledge of the Stack Exchange platform. A new 
community started recently: &lt;a href="http://moderators.stackexchange.com"&gt;Moderators&lt;/a&gt;. The idea behind this site is for people building, administering, managing or
cultivating digital communities to have a place to ask others with similar experiences questions. I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things a new site needs on the Stack Exchange network is a set of pro tempore moderators. While Stack Exchange 
believe in &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"&gt;community moderation&lt;/a&gt;, there are still some things that require more access. These pro tempore moderators
are those people. I &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/80/78"&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; myself for one such position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-nomination"&gt;The Nomination&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-nomination" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the nomination I presented to the community. In it, I discuss my experience with Vipers and some of our challenges.
One in particular that I mention is the &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html"&gt;automated language filter&lt;/a&gt; we have on the game servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an administrator/site owner of a medium sized gaming community that runs on a PHPBB3 board. We host multiple game 
servers as well. I've got a team of moderators that help keep the forum and game servers clean. I've run this site for 
5 years, after taking it over from the original creator of the community who wanted to move on. In my time as admin, 
we've seen the number of participants on the forum increase. We've seen our game server population increase as well. 
I attribute this to getting the community involved in change discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest changes occurred several years ago. Community members complained that our game servers would be over 
run with trolls at hours when moderators weren't available and spewing filth. The community wanted a cleaner game 
server experience. Users wanted these players gone immediately. Previous community leaders felt that trolling of this 
kind was part of the game and did nothing. After some discussions regarding what was and wasn't appropriate, we decided 
to be (for lack of a better term) "family friendlier". Certain 'extreme' phrases were no longer tolerated at all. A 
technical solution was built to automatically remove players that violated these rules. This solution allowed users to 
swear, but once it became excessive (again, defined by the community) they, too, were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool we have (PHPBB3) may not have the reputation, badges, or increasing privileges used here on Stack Exchange but 
for my community that has not been a negative. Engaging with the community in discussions and letting the members provide 
input that me and my team utilize has been extremely beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no experience moderating a Stack Exchange site. I don't feel that's a down side though. I can provide the 
"outside" perspective in a Stack Exchange heavy group. That does mean, though, that I'd depend on and expect the 
community to provide feedback on how moderation in being handled. Much like my existing gaming community, input from the 
community to the moderation team is important and the moderation team should be listening to that input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on August 12, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/138/78"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; to a moderator position on Moderators. I now "moderator the moderators", as the running joke 
has been on meta and the chatroom. I am looking forward to helping this community grow and to providing my experience 
of community management outside of Stack Exchange to this position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on December 4, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost since the beginning of Moderators, there have been conversations about whether the name is limiting our scope. We aren't
a community for &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; moderation questions. We are a community about how to build communities and moderation happens to
be a part of community building. (How many times can you say "community" before it sounds weird?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/140/78"&gt;Discussions&lt;/a&gt; began in August about possible name changes. These &lt;a href="http://meta.communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/175/78"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; continued into October as we worked on

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-not-to-appeal-a-ban.html"&gt;last week's post&lt;/a&gt;, I showed three ways that appealing bans on the Vipers forums would fail. Everyone makes mistakes
and we try to recognize that when someone comes to the forums and makes a good appeal. We usually offer an unadvertised 
"last chance". This is the chance to prove you've changed. If you fail, you are gone for good. If, however, you have changed
behaviors, this allows you to play on the Vipers servers again. To get this chance though, you have to make an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="super-secret-formula-for-getting-unbanned"&gt;Super secret formula for getting unbanned&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#super-secret-formula-for-getting-unbanned" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to a successful appeal is to do all of the following in your appeal thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post in complete sentences, using mostly correct english. I'm not going to mark you off for simple spelling mistakes, but
 I'm not going to read your post if it looks like you typed it from your phone to your teenage buddy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay polite. If you lose your cool, it's much less likely we are going to want to work with you. Remember, this is a game.
 You not being able to play on one server is not the end of the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why you think your ban was inappropriate. Make this short and to the point. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't lie. I have logs. I know how to read logs. I even have ways of quickly searching through the logs for specific
 times, if you provide that information. If your story doesn't match what I see in the logs, I'm not going to engage with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer questions from the admins. It's entirely possible you didn't provide a crucial bit of information or we need to 
 wait for input from the banning admin. In either case, if an administrator asks you a question, you should probably answer
 it. When you do so, follow the first two bullet points above. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is most of the appeals fail at step 1. These posts are to facilitate communication between the admin team
and the player that wants to return to the server. In these appeals I try to educate a player on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they were banned 
in the first place. If it's difficult to understand what is being said, it's very hard to have this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vipers"/><category term="team vipers"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>How NOT to appeal a ban</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/how-not-to-appeal-a-ban.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2014-04-14T22:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-14T22:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2014-04-14:/how-not-to-appeal-a-ban.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm reasonable.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running Vipers for about four and a half years. In that time I've seen my share of players get banned. The "good"
ones realize they screwed up and come back when the ban has expired and never have an issue again. These types of players
are common if they are first time offenders. The minute someone gets a second ban, the likelihood of them getting another
ban shoots way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-rules"&gt;Our Rules&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#our-rules" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vipers has five very simple rules. These are presented every time someone joins any of our game servers. They have to
click "Continue" to move past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Vipers Rules" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-rules.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a very simple structure for how bans work. Unless you are incredibly egregious in your behavior, or are out right
cheating by using hacks of some kind, you get a 4 strike policy. The ban length for the first three increases for each, but you
are allowed back. On the forth, we show you the door. Most of our bans are &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html"&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt;, thus are violating the very first rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bad-appeals"&gt;Bad appeals&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#bad-appeals" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing on our servers is not a right. It is not a guarantee. We are not obligated to provide a gaming environment for you
to spew your filth. If you can't meet our simple rules, you can leave. If you want to get back into the servers after your
forth offense, you have to come to us and ask. You should think about how you get someone to do what you want in "the
 real world".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-1-freedom-of-speech"&gt;Method 1: Freedom of Speech&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-1-freedom-of-speech" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this one is my favorite. Last I checked, I'm not the government of the United States. I'm a private citizen providing
a private server for others to play on. My server, my rules (technically, the community's rules, but you understand...)
I am not bound by the First Amendment to allow you to say whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Freedom of speech appeal" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-speech-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break down some of the flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, and most importantly, we do not have a member named "DarkWolf", let alone an admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DarkWolf was banned, automatically, 2 minutes prior to the person making this appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chat logs show that the person appealing even noticed the ban and made a comment. It was this comment that
 triggered the ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seen in this image is the response when this was pointed out and the appeal denied. The response managed to hit all
of the trigger words we ban for on the servers. Just in case we were reconsidering the denial, at this point we're not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-2-admin-abuse"&gt;Method 2: Admin Abuse&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-2-admin-abuse" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admins are evil and are holding a grudge! They hate me and ban for inappropriate language. Honest, I never said anything bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing how quickly that tune changes when I can produce exact, timestamped, logs with their Steam ID attached to it. It's even
more amusing when the admin being accused is "Zephyr", the automated process that watches for such language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Admin abuse appeal" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-abuse-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break down this one too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zephyr is a bot. It is not holding a grudge and it is not stalking you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swearing, unless very very excessive, isn't going to trigger a ban&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat logs show this is the 4th automated ban. In each ban, the user has managed to slip in multiple offensive phrases
 before being automatically kicked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-3-ranting"&gt;Method 3: Ranting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-3-ranting" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rant isn't helpful to anyone. It doesn't endear the poster to the community. The administrators don't want to read through
a rambling, unformated, exposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rant appeal" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-rant-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several logic errors and contradictions to their own arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't actually mention they are looking to be unbanned, just that they want to complain about the rules. (It's mentioned
 in a later post that they'd like to be unbanned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat logs clearly indicate the player was fond of certain slurs. This is the reason for the bans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="method-4-threats-to-the-server"&gt;Method 4: Threats to the server&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#method-4-threats-to-the-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats to attack the server in some way are not going to get you unbanned. There are only two possible outcomes to this
appeal type. Either you are successful and the server is off line (now how are you going to play even if unbanned) or we
ignore your tantrum and leave you banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DDOS appeal" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-ddos-appeal-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no reason to unban you. You've threatened the servers and made an ultimatum that effectively holds us hostage:
 "Either I get to play with you, or I'll take down your servers".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You offer no proof of your claims (unsurprisingly, none existed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above I've posted three of the most common methods people use to appeal their ban on the Viper servers. Every time one of
these types of appeals is posted, it is rejected and the player is told they aren't welcome. All I (and the community) ask
is a little bit of respect. You've already proven that you can't follow our rules if we reach this point. If you have truly
changed, why don't you demonstrate some of that change while requesting the ban be removed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vipers"/><category term="team vipers"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Mann Vs Vipers Beaten!</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/mann-vs-vipers-beaten.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2013-12-05T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-05T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2013-12-05:/mann-vs-vipers-beaten.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took months and endless hours of trying, but it's been done.

Last night a starving group of players finally put down Wave 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The players were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MooMooCow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CutieVamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starfox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy Cyanide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zhiv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team struggled against the Admin bots - InsaneMosquito, Venom and SchooledYa. I've been told we are terrifying to play
against and making us MvM bots with even higher stats made it even more terrifying. (I approve.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of Wave 9 from the victory. The winning strategy appears to be the one that works against us most of the time. 
Separate the medic (me), from the Heavy (Venom) and the Soldier (SchooledYa). Together, we're hard to stop, but apart we
can each be picked on for a while until there is no health left. The bots must have learned that weakness as well (I don't approve.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the winners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not sure when the video was taken down, as it is not a video on my account.

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11, 2013, Valve released a &lt;a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=11105"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; to Team Fortress 2 to limit idling. Idling is the process of launching
Team Fortress and then letting it run for a few hours and collecting item drops. It used to be simple to do by utilizing
the &lt;code&gt;-textmode&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_Line_Options#Command-line_parameters_2"&gt;game parameter&lt;/a&gt;. This would "launch" the game without graphics. From there, you just let it run and
come back in a few hours with 8-10 new items (your weekly limit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this was to then trade or craft these into metal. The metal could be used to trade for keys, hats, etc. and
all you to be "rich". The quotes are there because I do realize that being rich in a virtual game does not make one rich in
the real world. But, since the &lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann-Conomy_Update"&gt;Mann-Conomy Update&lt;/a&gt; introduced this massive meta game to Team Fortress, I've tried to stay
out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed. I didn't just idle one account. I idled 17 accounts. That is between 136 and 170 items a week. That's between 68 to 85
scrap metal a week. That's between 7.55 and 9.44 refined metal a week. That is between 3 and 4 keys a week (depending on
who I trade with). Keys are the backbone of the economy. Get enough of those and you can trade for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't know what my goal was. I wasn't interested in the fancy hats (ooooh...shiny pixels). I didn't open crates
with the keys. I did utilize the keys to get &lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tour_of_Duty_Ticket"&gt;Tour of Duty&lt;/a&gt; tickets for me and some friends. That's honorable, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-this-happen"&gt;How did this happen?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-did-this-happen" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html"&gt;the bot I built for Vipers to handle the raffles&lt;/a&gt;. I realized that I could automate much more
than trading with players. I could automate trading between bots. I could automate &lt;em&gt;crafting&lt;/em&gt; - which is relatively time
consuming, especially when you have 136 items to go through. I could automate trading with established scrap bank bots. These
bots will take any two weapon drops and give you one scrap, even if the two items can't be crafted together. The idea is
that they get enough weapons that eventually they'll be able to craft it down to metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-set-up"&gt;The set up&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-set-up" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To idle 17 accounts I needed to figure out what my computer could handle. I had to figure out how to run multiple instances
of Steam and Team Fortress at a time. Enter an application I'd utilized before: &lt;a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/"&gt;Sandboxie&lt;/a&gt;. This application provides
isolated sandboxes for applications to run in. Normally Steam won't run more than once on a machine. But, if you launch
it via Sandboxie, the host OS (and other Sandboxie environments) can't see that Steam is running in another instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of experimentation showed that I could handle 6 accounts idling at a time and have the computer remain just barely
usable. I created new accounts and split them into which day of the week they'd be run. I had three days out of the week
designated for idling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A batch script was built to launch the Sandboxie environments of the day that was to idle. Then it'd launch Team Fortress
in each of those environments. Then I'd go to bed. When I woke up the next morning, I'd shut down the environments. I'd
repeat this for two more nights. At the end of the third night, I had all the items I could get for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts could not be free accounts. This meant that I needed to either buy an item for each account, or trade for an
&lt;a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Upgrade_to_Premium_Gift"&gt;"Upgrade to Premium Gift"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="getting-items-to-a-single-account"&gt;Getting items to a single account&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#getting-items-to-a-single-account" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the process was to convert all the items to metal. Normally, this would take place by either logging into
each account and crafting there and then trading everything to a master account, or trading everything first then crafting.
In either case, 17 accounts is a lot to handle and trading/crafting is rather boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to modify the raffle bot. I'd designate one account as a master account. This would be the account that
received items. All others would dump items to it. I'd log into the account that was receiving items and initiate a trade
with each other bot in turn. I'd issue a command &lt;code&gt;add all&lt;/code&gt; and that bot would dump it's inventory into trade. Making it
through all the bots would take 5 minutes. Previously it would take me an hour or more to log into each account and
manually add items to the trade windows and then confirm the trade on both sides. &lt;em&gt;yawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="crafting"&gt;Crafting&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#crafting" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was crafting items to metal. The rule was that any two weapons utilized by the same class could be
crafted to scrap metal. That sounds simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of trial and error, I'd built a set of commands that would select compatible weapons and craft them together. This
particular aspect wasn't documented by Steam (or the reverse engineered SteamKit2 library I was utilizing). Crafting would
take about 15 seconds to get all compatible items to scrap and then combining 9 scrap to get a refined metal. This saved
inventory space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the simple command &lt;code&gt;craftall&lt;/code&gt;, all those new weapons would be crafted into metal and then combined into refined metal. This
would be done in less than a minute. Previously, I'd have to initiate each crafting session, add all items per craft, wait for the
craft to complete and then repeat. This was another 15-30 minutes saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="left-overs"&gt;Left overs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#left-overs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crafting, there would still be left over weapons. There were weapons that had run out of same class items to craft
with. The solution was to trade these away in groups of two to &lt;a href="http://scrapbank.me/"&gt;ScrapBank.me&lt;/a&gt; and get scrap metal back. This could be
further combined to refined metal again wasting space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="metal-to-keys"&gt;Metal to Keys&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#metal-to-keys" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, human intervention was required again. I had to convert my metal to keys. I did this via trading. The easy
way to do this was to find someone running a keybot, that would take metal for a key. Many exist, but all of them overcharge.
The other option was to look for a trader that was getting rid of a bulk set of keys and then trade them. In either case,
I'd end the week with 3-4 keys. I'd trade these for Tour of Duty tickets and go play a game with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual work required on my part was starting the idling for the night, shutting down idling in the morning, starting
the automated trade, crafting and trade left overs processes and finally trading metal for keys. What used to take me hours
to do each week, I could not do in less than an hour (the bulk of which ended up being trading metal for keys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-changed"&gt;What changed?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-changed" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve released a patch to limit how effective idling was. Their "Mann-Conomy" was seeing rapid inflation. The price of
keys (which they sold for physical money) in metal was rapidly increasing. From the time I started this to the time I ended
it, it jumped from 2-3 refined per key to 9-10 per key, with no sign of stopping. Casual players were complaining they couldn't
get enough items to trade for this stuff. The patch also required that you click to confirm each new received item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="im-ok-honest"&gt;I'm ok. Honest.&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#im-ok-honest" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried for a few days to find an effective work around. I didn't. When I wasn't able to find one, I transferred all items
to the master account and went through the process of converting to keys. With that, I purchased the final set of
Tour of Duty tickets. The idle bots were shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a month now. The bots are still down. I'm still around. Looking back on this, I'm happy Valve broke this. It wasn't
doing anything for me other than providing me with something to do: "Need to idle tonight", "Need to craft and trade today", etc.
Now I have that time back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased with the technical challenges I over came to get this done though. Crafting was the biggest, but I think I'm
most proud of the automated transfer of items to the master. Since the bots had to communicate via Steam and not via
a local application, working out how I was going to do that took some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, my friends, was my addiction to the meta game of a hat simulator in a first person shooter. I'm over it now and
looking forward to some other project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Side Activities"/><category term="automation"/><category term="programming"/><category term="gaming"/></entry><entry><title>Give some refined, Win some prizes</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2013-02-25T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2013-02-25:/give-some-refined-win-some-prizes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new raffle bot is introduced to the community&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;Financially, Vipers is supported by donations from the community. When the community doesn't cover the cost, I end up
covering the difference. This isn't my favorite thing to do in the world, but we've been pretty successful in the past. 
In recent months, though, we've been coming up short more frequently. This has motivated me (and the rest of the admin
team to find ways to cover costs). Now we have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-the-new-raffle-bot"&gt;Welcome to the new raffle bot&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-the-new-raffle-bot" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've built a Raffle bot based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot"&gt;SteamBot&lt;/a&gt;, which is the base of &lt;a href="https://scrap.tf/"&gt;scrap.tf&lt;/a&gt;. Entries to raffles will be one entry 
per refined metal. You can have an unlimited number of entries. I will convert the refined metal to various prizes 
(with the goal being keys most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we'll have the system select a set of winners from the entries. A user can only win once per raffle, so even if you you
have a gigantic number of entries, your odds of winning more than one position are zero. Only one win per steam id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the prices from &lt;a href="http://backpack.tf/"&gt;backpack.tf&lt;/a&gt;, the bot will determine the "value" of the items within the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-off-set-costs"&gt;How does this off set costs?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-this-off-set-costs" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items that are received that are of high value or any additional keys we can get based on raffle entries will be sold on 
various TF2 trading markets. The profits from these trades will be used to cover some community costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keep-high-value-items-for-future-raffles"&gt;Keep high value items for future raffles?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#keep-high-value-items-for-future-raffles" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This question was added based on feed back from the community. It was added on March 20, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to sell any such items. However, due to community feedback, I've changed my mind. We will utilize 
"high value" items as prizes for future raffles. These future raffles will not be announced until any running raffles are 
complete. It is also possible that such a raffle will run separately from the planned monthly ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-first-winners"&gt;Our first winners&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#our-first-winners" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on April 3, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first raffle completed at Midnight on April 1st. I was surprised by the number of entries we received. I'm even more 
surprised that the second one has begun and is already three quarters of the way to the number of entries it took a month
to receive. People want those keys, and I saw mention of those Bill's Hats too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of entries we received allowed us to completely cover the community costs that donations didn't cover. Thank
you to all our players that entered!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first winners are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cashprizes: Winner of 10 keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popinfresh: Winner of 7 keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iamthebaron: Winner of 4 refined metal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Guy From That Thing: Winner of 1 refined metal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This post explains how I've fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="stupid-soldier-spam"&gt;Stupid soldier spam&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#stupid-soldier-spam" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal of the crit server is fast game play, overpowered shots, and nearly instant death if you aren't paying attention.
The down side is the soldier spam. Lots of it. It's not unusual to have a team of soldiers spamming rockets. This is part
of the reason we stuck a class limit on Soldiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyro is a common way to counter a soldier firing at long range. The problem with pyro is that it has limited long range weapons 
in return. Unless you can sneak up on an enemy (not easy with spam and some of the maps), the pyro is stuck taking pot shots
with either the Flare gun or the shotgun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I added a plugin to the server that made Pyro much more effective at helping the team without needing to advance 
to the front line constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reflectiles"&gt;Reflectiles&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reflectiles" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflected Projectiles - Reflectiles, if you will - becoming homing projectiles when a Pyro air blasts them away. These
newly tracking projectiles will track an opposing team member and hunt them down. If the player being tracked dies before
the projectile hits them, the projectile will select a new target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that seems unfair. How do you defend against a homing projectile as a soldier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called &lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt; Fortress 2. You have team mates. Utilize them. That homing projectile can be reflected again by a Pyro
on your team. Each time a projectile is reflected it gets just a bit faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 20, 2015 with link to GitHub instead of the old SVN, my apologies for missing that link when migrating to this blog
It is important to note that this version hasn't been updated in a LONG time but was still functioning when Vipers shut
down. If it doesn't work, the first thing to try is updating SourceMod's gamedata. This was the fix every other time
it didn't work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is released on Github. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository is: &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins"&gt;https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vipers"/><category term="team vipers"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>Monitoring Language on the game servers</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2012-04-22T12:13:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2012-04-22:/monitoring-language-on-the-game-servers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Team Vipers is proud of it's friendly atmosphere. This post describes how I automated a large part of the process&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My admin tool of choice for the TF2 servers is &lt;a href="http://www.hlsw.org/"&gt;HLSW&lt;/a&gt;. It's decent at allowing me to manage a server without ever
needing to log to the server. My biggest complaint about it is that I can only watch the game chat of one server at a time.
Sometimes, it's helpful to see an ongoing conversation to resolve minor problems before they become big ones. For example,
claims of "hacking" usually turn out to be completely baseless. But, if multiple users (and more importantly, multiple
&lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; users) suddenly start mentioning a hacker, I can step in and resolve the problem without entering the server.
HLSW is good for this. A hacker is confined to one server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is when there are reports of lag across all of the game servers. Vipers has a dedicated machine that
runs 5 game servers. If all five suddenly report lag, there is a problem somewhere. With HLSW, though, I can't see all of
the servers at once. Thus, I've built a tool...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chat-monitor"&gt;Chat Monitor&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#chat-monitor" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All chat that occurs on the servers is logged. I've used this to resolve complaints of unfair bans and reports of hackers.
I built in a hook to these logs from the application template to quickly pull known aliases of users. It's been invaluable
in solving problems of "what happened" on the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Multiserver Chat monitor" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/vipers-chat-monitor.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've expanded it's usefulness. Now I can load a single page and see all chat activity occurring on all active game servers
on a single screen. It provides, at a glance, a quick way to see if there are problems on the servers. It also allows me
to step back from picking which server I think will be "bad" and monitor that. Now I can monitor all of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inappropriate-words"&gt;Inappropriate words&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#inappropriate-words" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community, we've chosen to set a higher standard for our players. As such, we have a restriction on a total of 3
words and a few derivatives of those words. This system is in place because the community stepped forward and wanted to
clean up the experience on the servers a bit. The problem with these higher standards is that we don't have admins on the
game servers (or watch chat logs) 24 hours a day. Thus, while admins sleep, a troll can wander through and spew garbage.
Unless a user reports this behavior, we will never be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've built a system to handle this automatically. The system will monitor chat logs across all servers. If a user hits the
threshold for banning, they will be removed from the server and banned for a day. The logic to the system is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="automated-removal-logic"&gt;Automated removal logic&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#automated-removal-logic" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inappropriate terms are configured with a "weight". This "weight" will be used to calculate whether or not a user
 surpasses a threshold set for being banned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System monitors chat logs for configured terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a term is found, the offending message is saved. The term weight is added to the user's current threshold value.
 If this is the user's first time saying one of these terms, they start at 0 and this weight is added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If user exceeds the threshold, the system issues a ban to Sourcebans. The user is then kicked from the game server.
 The ban length will be 1 day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system keeps messages for a total of 5 minutes. If a message is older than that, the system forgets it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the three inappropriate terms all have a threshold of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. This means they saying the words results in a ban.
Homophobic, racist remarks aren't welcome on the Viper servers. We can't prevent it, but we can deal with offenses swiftly.
The 5 minute window is added because the community requested that excessive swearing also be limited. We don't want to
outright ban it, but they don't want a swear filled rant to occur after every match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I built in the 5 minute window and the thresholds. The system is configured to catch common swear words, but the words
have a low weight. It'd take repeated spamming of the words in a 5 minute window to reach the threshold and be removed from
the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="updated-removal-logic"&gt;Updated removal logic&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#updated-removal-logic" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 17, 2012&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated system has been active for almost a month. I'm finding that the system has been removing the same set of
players every other day. They aren't learning. This is despite the message they are shown when removed from the server.
I've made a change to the logic in how long a ban will last. It provides a 4 strike system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First offence: Weight of term(s) said times 1. This means, for most cases, they are issued a single day ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second offence: Weight of term(s) said times 3. This means, for most cases, they are issued a three day ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third offence: Weight of terms said times 21. This means, for most cases, they are issued a three week ban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forth offence: Permanent removal from the game servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has been very enthusiastic about how quickly users of inappropriate terms are removed. I've seen a few minor
complaints about the permanent removal of users on the forth offense. I've told the community that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; a user protests the
ban and &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they can show they've learned our rules, I will provide one additional chance after the user has waited a minimum
of a month from from last time they were banned. If they return to their previous activities, they will be re-banned and
they will not be able to return in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 20, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2015, Team Vipers &lt;a href="https://andrewwegner.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish.html"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt;. With that shutdown, all chat monitoring also shut down. The system was active
from April 23, 2012 to January 4, 2015, for a total of 987 days. In that time, 4457 bans were issued for inappropriate
language. That is over 4 users a day being removed from our player base because they couldn't maintain a respectful
attitude. I consider that a success. I believe Viper community members did too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vipers"/><category term="team vipers"/><category term="automation"/><category term="programming"/></entry><entry><title>Connect Python to OSI Soft PI</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/connect-python-to-osi-soft-pi.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2012-02-07T12:45:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-04-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2012-02-07:/connect-python-to-osi-soft-pi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How I connected Python to OSI Soft PI&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OSI PI is a historian database. I had a task to connect a python application to this database. I asked a question on
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8898114/how-can-i-connect-python-2-6-to-osi-pi"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; about whether this was a simple problem to solve. After two weeks I still hadn't gotten a viable response,
so I had to build by own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did reach out to the vendor first for help. Their response back was not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like pyodbc is written against ODBC 3.x.  The OSI PI ODBC driver is using ODBC 2.0.  The python ODBC driver manager
will convert most ODBC 3 calls on the fly to ODBC 2 ones. Anything added to 3, however, will obviously fail. You would
need to find some way to make sure that your only using 2.0 compliant ODBC calls.  Currently their is not a PI ODBC
driver that is compliant with ODBC 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it looks like the vendor doesn't support Python (odd, they are named "PI", but I digress). Additionally, the drivers provided
by the company initially didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code below shows how I was able to finally connect python to OSI PI. It may not be the most elegant, but it
functions for the purposes of my application. Initially I was attempting to connect using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc"&gt;pyodbc&lt;/a&gt; module. Unfortunately,
OSI PI would return a message like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyodbc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IM002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;[IM002] [OSI][PI ODBC][PI]PI-API Error &amp;lt;pilg_getdefserverinfo&amp;gt; 0 (0) (SQLDriverConnectW); [01000] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The driver doesn&amp;#39;t support the version of ODBC behavior that the application requested (see SQLSetEnvAttr). (0)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They vendor mentioned that using OLEDB instead may prove more fruitful. Thus, the code below is how I got connected using 
the vendor provided OLDEB driver. The downside is that I also had to do this all through COM objects using &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32"&gt;win32com&lt;/a&gt;. 
I'm not knocking the module, because it is extremely useful and I've done some great things with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;win32com.client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed up on my Stack Overflow post about 2 months after posting my solution with the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just following up on this after using it for a couple months. This is still the only way I've found to do this with 
python, but it seems to be very slow when I need to run a large number of queries. I suspect it is because I have to 
open/close the database connection for each query, but OSI PI/ADODB complains if I do not. Performance has not reached a 
point where I am forced to rewrite this yet. If/when I do I will follow up again. In the meantime others using this 
solution should be aware that it is slow when running many queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-old-rtd"&gt;The old RTD&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-old-rtd" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viper's own LinuxLover, aka &lt;a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=38829"&gt;pheadxdll&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/index.php"&gt;SourceMod forums&lt;/a&gt;, wrote the &lt;a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=666222"&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; of the Roll the Dice
plugin. It has provided countless hours of fun for players. After all, who doesn't love getting Toxic while standing near an enemy 
spawn and hearing the rage as they die immediately. It's usually worth the instant death that follows when the effect
wears off ten seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were problems though. The biggest was that the chances of getting a Good vs Bad roll were not equal. Instead, you 
had a roughly equal chance of getting any roll. There were 14 possible rolls. You had a 1 out of 14 chance of getting a specific
effect. However, 9 of those effects were negative. Thus, you had a much higher chance of getting a negative effect vs a 
positive one. The other major problem was that it was very difficult to add new effects. Finally, with the released mod
not being updated, and LinuxLover departing Vipers to handle his own community on the Randomizer server, it was next to
impossible to get changes made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt;: LinuxLover released a new version of RTD (the 0.4 branch) sometime after we had forked the version we had. The new
version on SourceMod contains many of the same features we have. It does not, however, contain all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-new-rtd"&gt;The new RTD&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-new-rtd" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic for how rolls are determined has been changed. There is now a list of Good Effects and a list of Bad Effects. When
someone rolls, the first thing that is done is determine whether or not we are going to have a Good or Bad effect. That is a 
50/50 chance. Then it randomly selects one of the effects that are active and appropriate for the player's current class
that falls under the winning category. This should even out the Good vs Bad complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change that I've added is that we can now more easily add effects. Some new effects have been added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerplay: When Uber isn't enough...you need Kritz and Uber. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze Bullets: You've been shot! You should run away, but you can't. You're frozen in place for the next ten seconds, if 
 you're lucky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Bullets: A bullet wound isn't enough. You need to be on fire too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No crits: Haha! You are on an all crits server and you just lost your crits. Go sit at the little kid table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valve Rockets: We've included something that may be slightly overkill. You tell me:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+9900% damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+9000% clip size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+75% firing speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+500 health on kill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 seconds of crits on kill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+200% speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+60% reload time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because sometimes overkill is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been testing performance of this over the last few months. Today is the day that everyone can get it without
   an admin being around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that haven't seen it, here is one of our first tests back in November&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="videowrapper youtube"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OzHNr1Bz5QQ"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Headless Horseless Headmann: That's right, you can be the Halloween nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homing Projectiles: Is that soldier aimbotting?! Nope. His rockets are just following you where ever you go. Boom! Oh, 
 sniper arrows and pyro flares are probably something to avoid too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I added in the ability to log rolls to a database so that we can find fancy stats and ensure it's rolling fairly. I'll
update this post in a few months with some of our gathered stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="source-code"&gt;Source Code&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#source-code" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated May 20, 2015 with link to GitHub instead of the old SVN, my apologies for missing that link when migrating to this blog
It is important to note that this version hasn't been updated in a LONG time and all effects may not work any more. Specifically,
homing probably doesn't work because the Sidewinder extension had been broken by a Valve update in mid-2014. Other effects
should continue to work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is released on Github. It requires several common modules which are all available on the SourceMod forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository is: &lt;a href="https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins"&gt;https://github.com/AWegnerGitHub/Vipers-Server-Plugins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statistics"&gt;Statistics&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#statistics" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section was updated in January 2015 after the shutdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="good-vs-bad"&gt;Good vs Bad&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#good-vs-bad" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have exact stats on Good vs Bad rolls before the rewrite, but we started logging all rolls with the rewrite. This is the 
split of Good vs Bad. I am very happy with an almost exactly 50/50 split over nearly a million RTDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RTD Split" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/rtd-split.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="class-with-the-most-rtds"&gt;Class with the most RTDs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#class-with-the-most-rtds" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solider was the most popular class on the crit server. The images below show number of times our soldiers got certain rolls. Note that God Mode is 
low because the community decided having both God Mode and Powerplay was redundant. They decided to keep Power play. God Mode was
disabled about a year after this version was released. Homing is low because it wasn't implemented until about 18 months after
the initial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RTD Soldier" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/rtd-soldier.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="class-with-the-least-rtds"&gt;Class with the least RTDs&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#class-with-the-least-rtds" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medics rolled RTD the least number of times. This means sense for two reasons. First, they were not a common class on the crit server. When 
nearly everything is one hit, one kill, it's very hard to build uber. Second, when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; try to build Uber, ruining it with a 50/50
shot at getting a bad roll isn't good for the team. The low God Mode and Homing results are the same here as they were for the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-happened"&gt;What happened?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-happened" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the Christmas holiday, the Team Vipers forums were hit by "multiple" users who decided it was a good idea to use our community
as a battle ground. A Viper member stepped in to "help" resolve the problem by attempting to play mediator. (Notice the
air quotes. These are important later) The battling users turned on this member and escalated the matter to threats of violence.
When the member stopped responding, the users got bored and began spamming the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a combination of it being Christmas and the admins doing Christmas-y things with their families, this went on for
hours. There were several rounds of clean ups, but the battle continued over nearly a 48 hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-troll-different"&gt;Why is this troll different?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-this-troll-different" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Christmas festivities had ended and I had time to sit down in front of a computer to investigate what happened, I began
piecing together a time line of events. It turns out that all of these "users" were coming from the same IP address.
On top of that, they shared the same IP address as the member that attempted to "help". Odd...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-little-more-background"&gt;A little more background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-little-more-background" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The member that was "helping" had recently been approached by the admin team in an effort to clarify some questions about
their age. One of the admins had been presented evidence that the user was under the age of 16, which we all know if the
minimum age to be a Vipers member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user took this as a threat that we were going to remove them from the community entirely via bans on the servers and
forums. They posted a rant on their "sub-community". To mean this seems much more like a place where people that didn't
like our rules go to complain about us in an unproductive manner. I'm still not sure why they set up this community in
the first place, because they have always expressed a very keen interest in Vipers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="follow-up-with-the-member"&gt;Follow up with the member&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#follow-up-with-the-member" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started seeing a pattern between the battling users and the member, I sent a Steam message to the member asking
if they were around so that we could chat. The conversation began with me asking about the rant they posted and whether
or not they were aware that we allowed players under 16 to play on the servers, but not be members. They said they were
not aware of this and seemed pleased they'd still be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked them for their attempt to help over the holiday. Then I mentioned that it was odd that all of the users were
coming from the same IP address. It was agreed that was odd. When I said that there was another user that used that IP in
the past, they stopped responding. A few hours later I got a message saying they were back and around to talk again but
they'd closed the Steam chat window and lost the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later they began complaining that their own forum had been spammed. I'll admit I was curious, so I went to
take a look. There were multiple "users" having a very similar battle across the other forum. The member had posted messages
as the voice of the community that it had to stop or they'd issue bans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sick of the game at this point. I mentioned that I knew they were all of the users involved. I'd issued bans to the
user accounts on the forum. I revoked their Viper membership and banned their main account. I also made a note that they
could appeal the ban in 6 months time. I figured they'd forget about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes a special kind of troll to spam their own site to try and convince someone you aren't a spammer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="after-effect-of-the-bans"&gt;After effect of the bans&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#after-effect-of-the-bans" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the member was less than pleased. There were vague threats made against me, the server, and anything they
could think of that would offend me. I simply ignored the user on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn't sit well, apparently. The user attempted a denial of service attack on the game servers, which our hosting
provider mitigated. Part of this mitigation involves sending me a list of IP addresses that were attempting to connect
to the server at the time of the attack, and part of the traffic that automatically triggered their counter measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, there were only a few IP addresses. Geolocation says they are all in the same city. One of those IP addresses
is the IP of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-going-to-change"&gt;What is going to change?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-going-to-change" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I see out of all of this is that we didn't have active admins during the initial wave of spam. I can't fault
the admin team, after all it was Christmas. However, there have been a few requests recently for a couple more game server admins.
I feel this incident just confirms that we need a couple more. In the coming days, we'll announce who our new admins will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The member that has been removed has been banned from the servers and the forums. We've also destroyed two new user accounts
they created since the spam wave. This is business as usual. I did offer them the chance to appear at the end of June.
I suspect they will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-appeal"&gt;The appeal&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-appeal" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section was added on July 7th, 2011 after the user appealed their ban&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems I was wrong. They filed an appeal to their ban. Of course it took place over another holiday (4th of July). Fortunately,
our two European admins were still around while the rest of us were out enjoying some fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal was filed on the forums, as is usual. Community members stepped in to experess their unhappiness that the user
would consider returning after what they did over Christmas. One of the admins that were around put a message in the admin
area and asked for feedback from other admins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned home after some amazing fireworks, I found I had an email from our hosting provider. They'd blocked another
attempted denial of service attack. I logged into the forums to see what was going on and noticed that the appeal thread
was not going well. The user were getting more and more upset at the community members who were rallying against their
return. It eventually ended with a note saying that they hope Vipers never recovers from the DDOS. At this point one of the
other admins locked the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A check of the IP address the user was utilizing to post the messages and the list of IPs involved in the attempted DDOS
showed that the IP was on the list, and again they were all in the same city (and the same city as in December).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their appeal was rejected. They were informed they would not be welcome back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this appeal, I don't believe anything will need to change on our side. The appeal process concluded faster than normal.
Attempts to DDOS the community server makes the decision rather easy for the admins.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vipers"/><category term="team vipers"/><category term="moderation"/></entry><entry><title>Multiple IP addresses on the same physical network card</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/multiple-ip-addresses-on-the-same-physical-network-card.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2010-11-17T12:54:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-11-17T12:54:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2010-11-17:/multiple-ip-addresses-on-the-same-physical-network-card.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick walkthrough on how to configure a single network card to pull multiple IP addresses (RedHat based distribution)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are times when a server can be allocated more than one IP Address even though it contains only one physical
network card. To associate these IP addresses with the server some manipulation of networking settings will need to be
performed. The steps outlined in this walk-through are for RedHat based systems. This tutorial is for statically assigned
IP Addresses (as a server generally will have).
For this walk through we are going to add one additional IP address to &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt;. Navigate to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;code&gt;ifcfg-eth0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ifcfg-eth0:0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0:0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to modify the new file slightly so that it gets it's own IP address. Open &lt;code&gt;ifcfg-eth0:0&lt;/code&gt; in your favorite editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DEVICE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eth0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eth0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your file with the new settings. Now we need to restart the networking service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;service network restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the network components come back up you should see your new device in the &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; command. To add more IPs, 
copy and replace values as specified above.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Fixing MYISAM Crashed Tables</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/fixing-myisam-crashed-tables.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2010-05-14T10:08:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-14T10:08:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2010-05-14:/fixing-myisam-crashed-tables.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How to fix MyISAM tables that are marked as crashed&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, MyISAM tables are known to crash. When this happens, the following message will be displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;INVALID SQL: 145 : Table &amp;#39;{something}&amp;#39; is marked as crashed and should be repaired
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found this error occurs when MySQL is unexpectedly shut down - whether from a power failure to the entire server or
if MySQL itself has issues and you use the &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command to stop it. Unexpected shut downs, especially while these tables
are being used, do not make MyISAM tables happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, you need the ability to stop MySQL in a controlled manner, and you need to know where the database files
are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;locate *.MYI
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return where all the MYI files are stored. In this example, I am using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the directory of the crashed table using the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command. Next, stop MySQL. This is to ensure the tables are not
accessed while we perform our repair functions. If you don't perform this step, the repair may not succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;service mysqld stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we are going to perform two repair functions. The first one may take a while depending on the size of your tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;myisamchk -r --force --safe-recover *.MYI
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second repair step is used to ensure all table states are updated correctly and repair any minor indexing issues. It
is likely that this step is not needed after performing the previous step, but it should only take a few seconds now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;myisamchk --force --fast --update-state *.MYI
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, restart MySQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilight code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;service mysqld start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="Technical Solutions"/><category term="technical"/></entry><entry><title>Automated template for membership applications</title><link href="https://andrewwegner.com/automated-template-for-membership-applications.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2009-10-30T22:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-30T22:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Wegner</name></author><id>tag:andrewwegner.com,2009-10-30:/automated-template-for-membership-applications.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How Team Vipers improved user applications and admin participation in the process&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to long ago, applications for new membership in Team Vipers consisted of someone wandering onto the site, posting a
few words and an administrator saying they were accepted as a member. This worked when we were a small community. We
aren't small any more. We have 5 servers and hundreds of players a day. Each server has their own sub-community. There
are players joining the forums than entire groups of people have never met because they play exclusively on one game server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admins were also inconsistent in how (or if) they voted. Some admins didn't realize they could have a say, thinking it
was a privilege granted to only the senior administrators. We've built a system to resolve many of these problems and to
make the administration side easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-new"&gt;What's new?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#whats-new" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system presents all users with an application template. They fill out the form and the system handles the rest.
The New Users and Applications subforum has been modified so that no one, except the bot, can create topics. They
topics will only be created when the form is submitted. When a user applies to join Vipers, we will automatically
include relevant information about the user as we know them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HLStats information: This helps us get a sense of where they play and how often they play. It will help admins identify
 users they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; recognize based on the servers they frequent (because we all know certain servers are better than
 others ;) &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; Vanilla Nest vs Crits &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ban information: This will check if the user has any recorded bans in &lt;a href="http://www.sourcebans.net/"&gt;Sourcebans&lt;/a&gt;. It's important to know if the
 user has been banned previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Known aliases: Pulling information from our chat logs and Valve's profile page, we can build a list of known aliases.
 This helps identify users that frequently change names but have been around a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be other features we add in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 2012&lt;/em&gt; I've removed HLStats from the servers and removed it from new application information. We have
added a check of a user's &lt;a href="http://steamrep.com/api.php"&gt;Steam Reputation&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a user applies, they are put into a two week hold. During this week it is expected they will stick around the forums
and learn about the community they just applied to. Even better would be that they had done this before applying. While
this two week hold is in place, the administration team will be able to cast they votes in a separate sub-forum. They can
hold administration specific discussions - usually details that are important for admins to know, but don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be
public. Once voting is complete, if they become a member, the system automatically grants appropriate forum and server
related permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="voting-rules"&gt;Voting rules&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#voting-rules" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three admin "Yes" votes and zero "No" votes grants the user membership immediately after the two week window has expired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One or two "No" votes places a message on the user's application that the administrators are still considering the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three or more "No" votes rejects the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="possible-responses"&gt;Possible Responses&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#possible-responses" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="accepted-by-admin-team"&gt;Accepted by admin team&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#accepted-by-admin-team" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reach a total of three or more admin "Yes" votes, and do not get three or more admin "No" votes, you will be accepted
as a member of Vipers and automatically have your forum access modified. You will receive a message similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Accepted" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/application-accepted.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="denied-by-admin-team"&gt;Denied by admin team&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#denied-by-admin-team" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reach three or more "No" votes your application will be denied. This will occur even if you receive more "Yes" votes
than "No" votes. Vipers is not a majority rule community. The decision has been made that if three admins do not feel comfortable
accepting your application, you will not be granted membership. You will receive a message similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Denied by Admins" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/application-denied.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="denied-due-to-lack-of-votes"&gt;Denied due to lack of votes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#denied-due-to-lack-of-votes" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be accepted, your application requires a minimum of three "Yes" votes. If this can not be reached (and you also can't reach
 three "No" votes), your application will be rejected due to lack of votes from the admin team. This means that the admin team
 does not feel strongly either way about your application. Post on the forums. Play in the servers. Get to know our players
 and the community at large and then try again in a month. You will receive a message similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Application Denied with not enough votes" src="https://andrewwegner.com/images/application-denied-not-enough-votes.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat after me: "Age does not equal maturity." However, it has a very strong correlation. Over time we have learned that younger
 players tend to bring a lower maturity level that most of the community does not care for. As such, we've decided to set a minimum
 age requirement of 16. If a user indicates they are less than that, the system will reject their application with a message similar to
 this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 2010&lt;/em&gt; This process has been in place for a few months now. It has gone very well. We've reduced the clutter
in the applications forum. We've also seen the number of "forgotten" applications drop dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="original-announcement"&gt;Original Announcement&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#original-announcement" title="Permanent link"&gt;Â¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original announcement is posted here for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zephyr is an automated robot designed to improve our new member application process. The current process, which involves copying a template to a new thread and the potential for applications to become misplaced, is cumbersome and inefficient. The goal of Zephyr is to remove as much of the manual process as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, our new applicants will fill out an actual application online. The same information will be requested, but it will be in a more reliable format and will not require an applicant copy and paste anything between threads. This new application will be posted in the same forum as you're used to, and members will be freely able to comment and discuss the applicant via that thread. It will also display which date admin voting will be open, which is two full weeks after the original application post. This will hopefully cut down on any confusion related to the delay between application and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another note, from now on Zephyr will be the only user capable of creating new threads in the New Member Application forum. As previously stated, members will be able to post comments on existing threads, but the only new threads will come from the application process. This will keep the forum cleaner and help prevent applications from becoming lost or forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Zephyr is an automated robot. It is not programmed to respond to comments or questions. Doing so will not get your question answered. As always, if you have questions or comments about the application process, Zephyr, or anything else, you're welcome to send them to any admin. We'll be more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may all bow to your Robotic Overlord now.&lt;/p&gt;
