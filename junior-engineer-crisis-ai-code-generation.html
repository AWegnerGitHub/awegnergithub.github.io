<h2 id="the-data-that-changes-everything">The Data That Changes Everything<a class="headerlink" href="#the-data-that-changes-everything" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The software development industry is experiencing a shift that's happening faster than most organizations realize. Three statistics captured my attention this year, and collectively, they paint a picture of an industry in transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI now generates 41% of all code, with <a href="https://itsconchur.substack.com/p/41-of-code-is-now-ai-generated-should">256 billion lines written in 2024 alone</a>, according to Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque.</li>
<li>Software engineer job listings are down 35% from five years ago, according to <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/">The Pragmatic Engineer's analysis</a></li>
<li>AI tools make experienced, open source, software engineers 19% slower, not faster, based on a <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">randomized controlled trial by METR Research</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That last statistic flies in the face of all stories we're seeing at this point in 2025. Through my time scaling engineering teams, I've learned to pay attention when data contradicts conventional wisdom. If AI is making experienced engineers slower, what does that mean for how we think about productivity, learning, and career development in software engineering?</p>
<p>The implications extend far beyond individual productivity. They touch the core of how engineering teams function, how knowledge transfers between generations of software engineers, and ultimately, how we build the technical leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="the-productivity-paradox">The Productivity Paradox<a class="headerlink" href="#the-productivity-paradox" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The conventional narrative around AI in software development has focused on speed and efficiency. <a href="https://hatchworks.com/blog/gen-ai/generative-ai-statistics/">AI improves employee productivity by up to 66% across various roles</a>, according to recent studies. Yet when it comes to experienced software engineers, the opposite appears to be true.</p>
<p>The METR Research study revealed that when experienced engineers used AI tools, they took longer to complete tasks compared to working without AI assistance. This finding challenges the central assumption driving AI adoption in engineering teams.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-this-happen" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In my experience, software development isn't just about code generation. It's about problem-solving, architecture decisions, and understanding complex system interactions. When software engineers rely on AI to generate code, they often spend additional time not doing these. Instead they are reviewing and understanding what the AI spit out to ensure it aligns with system requirements. Then they spend time debugging the code due to missed requirements, edge cases, or lack of context provided to the coding assistant.</p>
<p>This productivity paradox reveals something crucial. The value of software development isn't in typing speed. It's in thinking speed.</p>
<h3 id="reality-check">Reality Check<a class="headerlink" href="#reality-check" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work">almost all companies are investing in AI, but just 1% believe they are at maturity</a>, according to McKinsey's 2025 workplace analysis. This suggests that even organizations themselves are struggling to effectively integrate AI tools into their development processes.</p>
<p>The disconnect between AI's promise and its current reality in software development creates a unique opportunity for engineering leaders who understand how to navigate this transition thoughtfully.</p>
<h2 id="the-mentorship-gap">The Mentorship Gap<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mentorship-gap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traditional software engineering career progression has followed a predictable pattern:</p>
<p>Junior Engineer -&gt; Mid-level Engineer -&gt; Senior Engineer -&gt; Technical Lead</p>
<p>This progression relied heavily on mentorship, code reviews, and the gradual transfer of knowledge from experienced engineers to new team members. AI is disrupting this learning pipeline in ways we're just beginning to understand.</p>
<h3 id="the-traditional-knowledge-transfer-model">The Traditional Knowledge Transfer Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-traditional-knowledge-transfer-model" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Historically, junior engineers learned through writing code that was reviewed by senior engineers. They also participated in pair programming and code reviews that taught best practices and patterns, and working on increasingly complex tasks. Crucially, they also debugged their own mistakes and <em>learned from failure</em>. Generative AI deprives the youngest team members of this skill because they are debugging code that was generated for them rather than by them. They don't have the depth of knowledge over this code snippet. They haven't spent hours working to solve a problem in <em>this one line of code</em>. The failure of the code is not their own, it's the AI's.</p>
<p>Each of these steps built not just coding skills, but engineering judgment to teach them the ability to make good technical decisions under uncertainty.</p>
<h3 id="the-ai-disrupted-model">The AI-Disrupted Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ai-disrupted-model" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now, increasingly, the model is that the AI generates code based on natural language specifications. Then a senior, not junior, engineer reviews the output. As the debugging loop starts, the focus is on the AI prompt engineering instead of the code. Code reviews become a validation of the AI and aren't teaching moments any longer. Junior engineers solve less problems and babysit the AI instead.</p>
<p>This shift significantly changes the nature of mentorship on engineering teams.</p>
<h3 id="the-hidden-cost">The Hidden Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hidden-cost" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>When senior engineers spend their time reviewing AI-generated code instead of mentoring junior engineers, we lose the critical element of human knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>A senior engineer reviewing a junior's code can ask questions like:
- "Why did you choose this approach?"
- "What other options did you consider?"
- "How would this handle increased load?"
- "What happens if this service is unavailable?"</p>
<p>These questions build engineering judgment. But when reviewing AI-generated code, the questions become:
- "Did the AI choose the right pattern?"
- "Does this handle our edge cases?"
- "Is this consistent with our architecture?"</p>
<p>The learning opportunity shifts from building problem-solving skills to validating AI decisions.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-really-losing">What We're Really Losing<a class="headerlink" href="#what-were-really-losing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The impact of AI on junior engineering roles goes beyond individual career paths. We're potentially losing institutional knowledge, problem-solving capabilities, and the human intuition that comes from learning to code through struggle and iteration.</p>
<h3 id="problem-decomposition-skills">Problem Decomposition Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-decomposition-skills" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the most valuable skills a software engineer develops is the ability to break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. This skill typically develops through experience. This is through encountering problems that are too big to solve all at once and learning to approach them systematically.</p>
<p>When AI handles this decomposition automatically, junior engineers don't develop this critical thinking muscle. They become skilled at describing problems to AI rather than solving them independently.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-intuition">Debugging Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging-intuition" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Experienced engineers often talk about having a "gut feeling" about where bugs might be hiding or what might cause a system to fail under load. This intuition develops through years of debugging their own mistakes and understanding how systems fail in practice.</p>
<p>AI-generated code fails differently than human-written code. It might be syntactically correct but miss business logic edge cases. It might follow patterns perfectly but make assumptions about data that don't hold in production. Learning to debug AI code is a different skill from learning to debug human reasoning errors.</p>
<h3 id="architectural-thinking">Architectural Thinking<a class="headerlink" href="#architectural-thinking" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Understanding why certain architectural patterns exist, when to apply them, and how they impact system behavior requires experience with the consequences of different choices. This understanding traditionally developed through making mistakes, seeing systems break, and learning from the aftermath.</p>
<p>When AI makes many of these architectural decisions automatically, junior engineers may learn to recognize good patterns without understanding why they're good or when they might be inappropriate.</p>
<h3 id="the-compound-effect">The Compound Effect<a class="headerlink" href="#the-compound-effect" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps most concerning is the compound effect of these changes. If junior engineers don't develop problem-solving skills, debugging intuition, and architectural thinking, who becomes our next generation of senior engineers?</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.to/itamartati/why-software-engineers-are-finding-it-harder-to-get-a-job-in-2025-the-changing-standards-of-hiring-19po">Software engineers are finding it harder to get jobs in 2025 due to changing hiring standards</a>, according to analysis from the software engineering community. The bar for what constitutes "junior engineer" skills is rising, but the pathways to develop those skills are being disrupted by AI.</p>
<h2 id="the-strategic-response">The Strategic Response<a class="headerlink" href="#the-strategic-response" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The organizations that thrive in this transition won't be the ones that embrace or reject AI wholesale. They'll be the ones that thoughtfully integrate AI while preserving the human elements that create strong engineering teams.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-market-reality">Understanding the Market Reality<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-the-market-reality" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite these challenges, <a href="https://www.turing.com/blog/software-development-statistics">employment opportunities for software engineers are still expected to grow by 20%</a>, according to recent market analysis. This suggests that demand for engineering talent remains strong, but the nature of that talent is evolving.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/how-an-ai-enabled-software-product-development-life-cycle-will-fuel-innovation">McKinsey's analysis indicates that AI has the potential to fundamentally transform software development processes</a>, but successful transformation requires deliberate strategy, not just tool adoption. This point bears repeating because it's vital for leaders to understand.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Successful transformation requires deliberate strategy, not just tool adoption</p>
</div>
<p>Bringing Copilot, Cursor, or other AI coding assistants to your team does not guarantee success. It is <em>a</em> step in being successful in the AI transformation. It is not <em>the</em> step.</p>
<h3 id="three-strategic-approaches">Three Strategic Approaches<a class="headerlink" href="#three-strategic-approaches" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Based on my experience scaling engineering teams and observing successful AI integration, three strategic approaches are emerging.</p>
<p>The first approach is redefining what it means to be a "Junior Engineer." Instead of eliminating junior positions, successful organizations are redefining what junior software engineers need to be good at. Traditionally, a junior engineer would be able to write syntactically correct code, follow team development patterns, understand the language and framework used by the team to a degree, and be able to implement requirements that are well defined.</p>
<p>However, a new AI-era junior engineer needs different skills. They need to be able to analyze and decompose a problem, showing system thinking and architecture understanding. This enables them to collaborate with AI coding assistants to generate solutions that actually solve the problem. Critically, they can perform a review of this output.</p>
<p>The most effective teams I've observed use AI as a teaching tool rather than a replacement for learning. Junior software engineers work with both AI tools and senior engineers, using AI to handle boilerplate while focusing human mentorship on architectural decisions and problem-solving approaches. This keeps several of the mentorship gaps minimal and builds a foundation that today's junior engineers can build on as they grow in their careers.</p>
<p>I've also heard of teams implementing regular "AI-free" coding sessions for engineers to ensure they can solve problems without the assistance of the AI tooling to build their early troubleshooting and debugging muscles. This type of thing also has been extended to code reviews, where an engineers must be able to explain why the AI tool took certain approaches and if their are alternatives that might have been better.</p>
<p>Personally, these approaches feel somewhat academic. A junior engineer is still a professional not a student in school. I think there could be good training around these ideas, but I don't think it should feel like we are taking away a tool. Instead, teach how to use it correctly while filling in the knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>In my experience, successful teams are making knowledge transfer deliberate through recording architectural decisions that were made and what alternatives were considered. Through troubleshooting sessions, problem solving sessions, and "pair support" to dive into complex system problems.</p>
<p>Mentoring from anyone to anyone is important too. Everyone on the team has something to contribute and teach. Whether it's complex system architecture that a senior engineer shares with a more junior team member or having a junior engineer lead a session on how they solved a problem. All of this is important for the whole team.</p>
<h2 id="redefining-junior-engineer-value">Redefining Junior Engineer Value<a class="headerlink" href="#redefining-junior-engineer-value" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The key insight is that AI doesn't eliminate the need for junior developers. It changes what makes junior software engineers valuable, though.</p>
<h3 id="code-generation-to-code-curation">Code Generation to Code Curation<a class="headerlink" href="#code-generation-to-code-curation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In an AI-first world, junior software engineers become code curators rather than code generators. They will evaluate AI generated solutions for correctness, efficiency and maintainability. They'll identify edge cases the AI misses. They'll take AI generated code and ensure it works within their area of responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="new-core-competencies">New Core Competencies<a class="headerlink" href="#new-core-competencies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most successful junior software engineers I've worked with in AI-enabled teams demonstrate the ability to think about entire systems, assess code quality, break down problems clearly, and strive to learn and adapt to new tools which allows them to build a method of debugging code they didn't write themselves.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-forward" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The software engineering industry is experiencing a shift, but it's not the first time. We've navigated the transition from assembly language to high-level languages, from procedural to object-oriented programming, from desktop to web to mobile development. Each transition created new opportunities for those who adapted thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The current AI transition is no different, but it requires us to think carefully about what we're optimizing for. If we optimize purely for short-term code generation speed, we risk creating a future where we have powerful AI tools but fewer humans who understand how to use them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="the-organizations-that-will-win">The Organizations That Will Win<a class="headerlink" href="#the-organizations-that-will-win" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The organizations that thrive in this transition will be those that preserve human judgment while leveraging AI capabilities. Organizations that invest in developing people while adopting new tools and capabilities will have a key success factor. These are the organizations that create space for engineers to learn and build engineering thinking into their processes. Most importantly, teams that <a href="https://andrewwegner.com/scaling-teams-without-losing-culture.html">maintain their cultural</a> values while adapting processes will find engagement instead of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="the-individual-path-forward">The Individual Path Forward<a class="headerlink" href="#the-individual-path-forward" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>For individual engineers, especially those early in their careers, the path forward involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embracing AI as a tool while building problem-solving skills that transcend any specific technology.</li>
<li>Focusing on system thinking and architectural understanding that AI currently cannot replicate.</li>
<li>Developing communication skills that allow you to work effectively with both AI tools and human teams.</li>
<li>Building debugging and quality assessment capabilities that work regardless of who or what generated the code.</li>
<li>Maintaining curiosity about how things work, not just how to make them work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The junior engineer crisis isn't really about AI replacing entry-level engineers. It's about ensuring that as we integrate powerful new tools into our development processes, we don't lose the human elements that create strong engineering teams and effective technical leaders.</p>
<p>I argue that every significant technology shift creates winners and losers. The winners are those who adapt early and thoughtfully, who understand both the capabilities and limitations of new tools, and who invest in building the human skills that remain uniquely valuable.</p>
<p>The current moment represents a unique opportunity for engineering leaders to shape how AI integration happens in their organizations. The choices we make now about hiring, training, mentorship, and team structure will determine whether AI makes our engineering teams stronger or simply faster.</p>
<p>AI is already reshaping our industry. The question is whether we'll guide it in directions that build stronger teams and better engineers, or whether we'll optimize for short-term productivity at the expense of long-term capability.</p>
<p>The junior software engineers we hire and train today will become the senior engineers leading teams in 2030. How we prepare them for that role, in partnership with AI rather than in replacement by it, may be one of the most important strategic decisions we make as engineering leaders.</p>
